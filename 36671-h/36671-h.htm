<h2>A House Party With the<br />Tucker Twins</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MAXTON</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> may be more fun than a house-party,
but I doubt it. Certainly I, Page Allison, have
never had it. What could be more delightful
than to spend two weeks in a beautiful old
country home with such a host as General Price,
and to have as fellow guests all the girl friends
you care for most in the world,&mdash;to say nothing
of some of the male persuasion that at least you
don't hate?</p>

<p>Harvie Price had been promised this house-party
by his grandfather as reward of merit, and,
like most things earned by hard labor, it proved
to be worth the work expended. The Tucker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Twins of course were there, Mary Flannagan,
Shorty Hawkins, George Massie (alias Sleepy),
Wink White, Jim Hart, and Ben Raglan, whose
other name was Rags. There were two men from
the University whom we did not know before, but
it did not take long for us to forget that they were
new acquaintances. They fitted in wonderfully
well and a few hours found them behaving like
old and tried friends. Their names were Jack
Bennett and Billy Somers, and both of them
hailed from Kentucky. There was a new girl in
the party, Jessie Wilcox. She wasn't quite so
easy to know as the new boys.</p>

<p>I always feel like crying when I think of dear
little Annie Pore's connection with that house-party.
She was of course the very first person
Harvie asked, the one he wanted most. I think
in his mind the party was given to Annie, and
when Mr. Pore with characteristic selfishness and
stubbornness refused to let her go, it was a blow
indeed.</p>

<p>His plea was that he needed her to keep the
store for him. He had hired a clerk after Annie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
went to boarding-school, and owing to his growing
business, had kept the boy on through vacation,
but on the eve of the house-party had seen
fit to get rid of him, having sent him on an unasked
for and undesired holiday.</p>

<p>"I found it out only this morning," said
Harvie gloomily.</p>

<p>He had come to meet us at the landing, most
of us having arrived by boat from Richmond.
He was doing his best to look cheerful, feeling
that a cloud must not be cast over the entire
party because one member could not be there.
He said he felt he knew me well enough to speak
out on the subject of Mr. Pore, and speak out
he did.</p>

<p>"But has your grandfather tried to persuade
him to let her come?"</p>

<p>"No! You see Grandfather is a great believer
in State's Rights, and he carries his theories
down to the individual. He says that Mr. Pore
is a wrong-headed father but it is his own affair
and he refuses to interfere. He takes the stand
that he has no more right to dictate to Mr. Pore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
how to run his household, than Massachusetts
had to interfere in our own little matter of slavery
here in Virginia, back in the sixties."</p>

<p>"Poor Annie! We shall have to work out
some kind of a scheme for her. I'll tell Mary
and the Tuckers. I am sure we can get the
tiresome old Englishman to come around somehow."</p>

<p>"I wish I thought so, but I tell you that Mr.
Arthur Ponsonby Pore has never been known to
change his mind. Besides he is leaving to-day
for Richmond to be gone several days."</p>

<p>That is often the way with persons who have
not much mind to change; they seem to have none
to spare; but Mr. Pore was a cultivated, learned
gentleman,&mdash;surely he was amenable to reason.</p>

<p>Price's Landing was a quiet little wharf almost
hidden by the overhanging willows. It took
the boat only a moment to drop one mail bag and
take on another, or to do the same by the occasional
passengers. It seemed hardly worth while
to go through the motions of landing for such
small traffic, but Harvie assured us that in watermelon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
time or when tobacco was being shipped
they were a very important trading point, one of
the busiest along the James.</p>

<p>The village was about an eighth of a mile back
from the landing and it looked as though not even
watermelon time could wake it up. There were
two stores, Mr. Pore's and a rival concern; a
blacksmith shop, sprawling far out in the road; a
schoolhouse; three churches; a post-office; and
four residences.</p>

<p>"I'd like to stop and have all of you see Annie
now, but Grandfather is expecting us and perhaps
we had better come back later on," said
Harvie, who was driving one of the vehicles sent
to meet us.</p>

<p>The road to Maxton, the Prices' place, skirted
the village and then went directly up quite a steep
elevation. The house was built on top of the
hill commanding a fine view of the river. The
lawn sloped down to the water's edge where one
could see a very attractive boat-house and several
boats riding at anchor.</p>

<p>"Lovely! Lovely!" we exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm mighty afraid I'm going to run down
that hill and jump in the water," cried Dum.</p>

<p>"Well, hills are certainly made to run down
and water to jump in," declared one of the new
acquaintances, Billy Somers, who was standing
on the springs of the vehicle in the rear holding
on by the skin of his teeth and the back seat. "I
bid to do what you do."</p>

<p>The mansion (one could not call it just plain
house) was a perfect specimen of colonial architecture,
red brick of a rich rare tone with a great
gallery across the front, the roof of which was
supported by huge white pillars. The front door
was a marvel of beautiful proportions, line and
detail. A great ball might have been given on
the porch, or gallery, as it is called in the South.
Indeed, a sizable party might have been held
on each one of the broad stone steps that led to
the lawn. Only a very long-legged person could
go up or down those stairs without taking two
steps to a tread.</p>

<p>A house like Maxton is very wonderful and
beautiful but somehow never seems very homelike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to me. Every time you go in and out of your
front door to have to tackle those stairs would
take from the homey feeling. Now at my home,
Bracken, you are closer to Mother Earth and not
nearly so grand and toploftical.</p>

<p>Standing on the gallery to greet the guests
were General Price and his maiden sister Miss
Maria, the general tall and stately and Miss
Maria short and fat. It was easy for the brother
to look aristocratic and dignified, in fact he could
not have looked any other way, so deserved no
credit; but for the sister to look equally so was
a marvel. Her figure reminded me of Mammy
Susan's tomato pincushion, a treasure I had been
allowed to play with in my childhood. She was
quite as round in the back as the front and her
waist was like the equator: an imaginary line extending
from east to west. Her face was in keeping
with her figure, round and fat, but through
those rolls of flesh the high born lady looked out.
Her voice was very sweet and the hand that she
extended to us was as white as snow. She must
have been about seventy years old, but thanks to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
her rotundity there were no wrinkles on her pink
and white face. Of course she was dressed in
black silk and old lace! How else could she have
been clothed?</p>

<p>The general would have served as a model for
the make-up of a movie actor in a before-the-war
film. The Tuckers and Mary and I decided later
on that we felt just like a movie as we went up
those grand broad steps with our host and hostess
at the top.</p>

<p>The hall carried out our feeling of being on
the screen.</p>

<p>"My, what a place to dance!" whispered Dee
to me, but General Price heard her and smiled
his approval. He was dignified himself but we
were thankful he did not expect us to be.</p>

<p>"You shall dance here to your heart's content,
my dear. Many a measure has been trod in this
hall."</p>

<p>Dee looked a little depressed at being expected
to tread a measure. That sounded rather
minuetish to the modern ear. We wondered
what he would think of the dances of the day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Maxton was laid out in the form of a cross
with two great wings, one on each side of the hall.
The girls were lodged upstairs in one wing, the
boys in the other. Downstairs in the boys' wing
were the parlors and smoking room and General
Price's chamber and office; in the girls', the dining
room, breakfast room, sewing room, chamber,
linen room, storeroom, Miss Price's chamber
and her small sitting room where she directed her
household. There was a basement with more
storerooms, pantries, a billiard room and a
winter kitchen, but in the summer an outside
kitchen was used. All of these things we found
out later on a tour of inspection with our hostess.</p>

<p>The great hall ran through the house and the
back door was exactly like the front. Thanks to
the lay of the land, however, there was not quite
such a formidable array of steps. It seemed
much more homelike in the back than the front.
From the rear gallery one stepped into a formal
garden, gravel paths, box hedges, labyrinth and
all.</p>

<p>"Oh, ain't it great, ain't it great?" cried Mary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
dancing up and down the waxed floor of the great
bedroom she and I were to occupy. Dum and
Dee Tucker were put in the room with the other
girl, Jessie Wilcox. If Annie could have come
she was to have been with Mary and me.</p>

<p>"I've got no business calling it great, though,"
she said as she stopped prancing, "when Annie
can't be here. What are we to do about it, Page
Allison?"</p>

<p>"Let's call Tweedles in consultation. They
can think up things."</p>

<p>Tweedles were very glad to come. Miss Wilcox,
who had motored over to Maxton several
hours ahead of us, had already taken possession
of the room and had begun to unpack her many
fluffy clothes. Miss Maria had introduced all of
us to our fellow visitor and had graciously expressed
a desire that we should be good friends.
We were willing, but it remained to be seen
whether the stranger would meet us half way.
She was a beautiful little creature with dark eyes
and hair. Evidently she was very dressy or she
would not have had to take up two double beds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and all the chairs with her clothes. She seemed
to have no idea of making room for the Tuckers
nor did she make any excuse for spreading herself
so promiscuously.</p>

<p>"She needn't think I am going to move them,"
said Dum. "If they aren't off my bed by bedtime,
I'll just go to sleep on them. I wish we
could come in with you girls."</p>

<p>"Of course that would never do," declared
Dee. "We must stay where Miss Price put
us."</p>

<p>"Maybe Miss Wilcox will turn out to be fine,"
I suggested, hoping to turn the tide of Dum's
disapproval.</p>

<p>"Fine! She's too fine. I wish you could see
her fluffy ruffles. But this isn't thinking up
something to do about poor little Annie. My, I
wish Zebedee could have come!"</p>

<p>We all wished the same thing, but since he
couldn't come we felt we must think up something
for ourselves.</p>

<p>"He could have talked old Ponsonby Pore
into letting Annie come, I just know," said Dee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe we could do the same thing," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Harvie says nothing will move him."</p>

<p>"Well, one thing sure, we can go to see Annie
and he can't drive us out, not after he has visited
us at the beach. He'll just have to be polite to
us."</p>

<p>"Can't she come up in the evening? Surely
she must stop keeping store sometimes," asked
Mary.</p>

<p>"Country stores never close. At least the one
near us never does. They might miss the sale of
a box of matches or a stick of candy. I used to
think, when I was a little girl, that I would rather
keep a store than do anything in all the world.
I talked about it so much that Mammy Susan
got right uneasy about me."</p>

<p>"Well, Harvie and Sleepy are blue enough
about it, so we must cheer up," said Dee. "We
are to be here two weeks and if we behave real
well maybe they will ask us for longer, and surely
in that time we can make that old stickinthemud
come around. Zebedee could think up a way in
a minute."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE COUNTRY STORE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prices had the right idea about entertaining
a crowd of young people: that was to let them
entertain each other. If a dozen boys and girls
can't have a good time just because they are girls
and boys then there is something very dull about
them and the combination is hopeless. There was
nothing dull about this crowd gathered in the
hospitable Price mansion. Harvie was too well
bred to let the disappointment about the non-appearance
of one guest make him neglect the
others. Poor George Massie was the one who
could not conceal his feelings. Annie was the
first and only girl he had ever cared for and now
he sat, a mountain of woe, consuming large quantities
of luncheon as though the business of eating
were the only solace in life.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Sleepy, the worst is yet to come!"
teased Rags.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Sleepy only groaned and dismally accepted
another hot biscuit. The funny thing about
Sleepy was that he was so in love with Annie that
he did not at all mind being teased.</p>

<p>"I am going down to see Annie right after
luncheon. Don't you want to go too?" I whispered
to Sleepy who was next to me.</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"We are trying to think up a plan by which
we can get her hateful old father to let her join
us here."</p>

<p>"Brute!"</p>

<p>"Don't you think the girl is pretty, sitting
next to Wink?"</p>

<p>Miss Wilcox had plunged into a flirtation with
that budding young doctor, placed on her right,
not forgetting to turn to her left quite often to
include Jack Bennett in her chatter.</p>

<p>"No! Like blondes best!"</p>

<p>Miss Wilcox looked up quickly. I was almost
sure she had heard Sleepy. She glanced quite
seriously around the table, regarding each girl
intently. Certainly there were no decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
blondes there except Mary Flannagan, whose
hair was red, and even the best friends of dear
old Mary could not call her beautiful. The
Tucker twins were more brunette than blonde,
Dum's hair being red black and Dee's blue black.
As for me, Page Allison, I was neither one thing
nor the other. My hair was neither light nor
dark and my eyes were grey. She need not look
at me so hard. I wasn't the blonde that Sleepy
liked best.</p>

<p>Farther acquaintance with Jessie Wilcox explained
her concern over Sleepy's remark. She
was a very nice girl just so long as she was "it,"
but she could not brook a rival of any sort. She
must be the center of attraction, admired by all,
praised by all. The minute she felt that there
was someone who was considered more beautiful
than she was, could dance better, sing better, do
anything better, that minute she was a changed
being.</p>

<p>Her previous visits to Maxton had been very
delightful as she had always been praised and
petted to her heart's content. Both General<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Price and his sister were devoted to her and she
was ever a welcome visitor. Her grandfather's
home was about ten miles from Price's Landing,
and whenever she came from New York to see
him she must spend part of her time with the old
people at Maxton. Harvie admired her very
much, as who would not? She was beautiful, intelligent,
very quick-witted and charming. He
had never seen her with any other girl except her
best friend, who on one occasion had been at
Maxton with her, and this friend, being hopelessly
plain and rather slow of wit, but served as
a foil to the little beauty.</p>

<p>After overhearing Sleepy's announcement
about blondes, she looked at me so steadily that I
began to blush. I was suddenly very conscious of
my tip-tilted nose and of the added toll of
freckles that the summer always exacted from it.
I wondered if anyone else was noticing the almost
disagreeable expression of her usually sweet
countenance.</p>

<p>I was glad when Miss Maria arose as a signal
for us to leave the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make yourselves at home!" the general said
in his hospitable way. "Maxton is yours to do
with as you please. There are horses in the
stables for any of you who want to ride or drive;
there are boats on the river; there are swings on
the lawn; the tennis court is in condition for
matches if you care to play. All I ask of you is
not to fall off the horses or let them run away
with you and kill you; and not to tumble into the
river and drown."</p>

<p>"That seems a reasonable request," I laughed.
"How about falling out of the swings or beating
each other up with tennis rackets?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well! I must not put too many restrictions
on youth," he said, pinching my
ear.</p>

<p>Jessie looked at me again rather severely and
once more I felt mighty freckled.</p>

<p>"Let's get a rig and go see Annie," suggested
Sleepy.</p>

<p>"All right! Tweedles and Mary want to go,
too."</p>

<p>"Let's get in ahead of them," he pleaded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on, Page!" shouted Dum. "We
want you in a set of tennis."</p>

<p>"Now I was just going to ask her to come for
a row," cried Dee. "Wink and Jim told me to
engage you. They have gone to see about the
boat."</p>

<p>"Sorry, but I've got a date with Sleepy."</p>

<p>"Humph! Miss Allison seems to be rather in
demand," said Jessie to Jack Bennett. She said
it in a low voice but I heard quite distinctly.</p>

<p>"Yes! They say she is the most popular girl
at her school."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so? I can't see the attraction."</p>

<p>"Well, she must have it because girls like her
as well as the fellows. They say Dr. White is
terribly smitten on her."</p>

<p>"Absurd!"</p>

<p>I quite agreed with her. The sooner Wink
White stopped hypnotizing himself into thinking
he was in love with me, the better I would
have liked it. Of course every girl likes to have
attention, but I thought entirely too much of
Wink to be pleased to have him looking at me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
like a dying calf. He was such a nice boy, so
good looking, so clever, so agreeable,&mdash;except
when he was alone with me. Then his whole nature
seemed to undergo a change. I dreaded being
left with him and usually managed to avoid
it. He was my fly in the ointment of this house-party.
I did not at all relish having this young
Kentuckian state it as a fact that Wink was interested
in me. Jessie Wilcox was welcome to
him if she could persuade him to transfer his
affections.</p>

<p>Sleepy and I skimmed away in a spruce red-wheeled
buggy with a young horse that evidently
liked to be moving.</p>

<p>"Fierce about Annie!" he said. "I'd like to
wring that old duffer's neck."</p>

<p>"I hope he has gone before we get there,
then," I laughed. "If Mr. Tucker could only
get hold of him, I bet he could bring him around."</p>

<p>Mr. Pore had not gone, however, when we
drew up at the cross roads where the country
store stood. He was engaged in trying to sell a
large rake to a farmer, while Annie was busily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
employed in measuring off two yards and three-quarters
of unbleached cotton for the farmer's
wife and then computing the amount due when
the cotton was worth eight and two-third cents a
yard. She completed the calculation just as we
came in.</p>

<p>How glad she was to see us! Mr. Pore seemed
pleased to renew my acquaintance, too. He gave
only a formal greeting to Sleepy but shook my
hand in what he meant to be a cordial way. The
fact that I was part English and that part of me
came up to his idea of social equality, made him
look upon me as desirable. He had not forgotten
that my mother and his wife had been friends in
England. He honestly felt that there were no
Americans who were his equals. General Price
might be almost so, but not quite. He saw no
reason why his beautiful daughter should not
spend her young life weighing out lard and measuring
calico for negroes, but every reason why
she should not demean herself by mixing socially
with any but the highest.</p>

<p>Mr. Pore's store was like every other country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
store except that it was perhaps a little more orderly,
not much though. Order in a country
store seems to be impossible. The stock must be
so large and so varied to suit all demands that
there never is room for it. I have never seen a
country store that was not crowded. How the
keepers of such stores ever take stock of their
wares is a mystery to me. Perhaps they never
do, but just go on buying when the supply gets
low, and selling off as they can, putting money in
the till until it gets full and then sending it to the
bank. Usually they run their affairs in a haphazard
manner and their books would defy an
expert to straighten out. No matter from what
walk of life the country storekeepers are drawn,
they are all more or less alike, whether they are
younger sons of the nobility as was Mr. Pore or
elder sons of the soil (with much soil sticking to
them) as was old Blinker, who ran the rival emporium
at Price's Landing. They always have
more stock than they have store, and their books
usually look as though entries had been made upside
down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pores' store had shelves stretching from
one end to the other, down both sides and reaching
as high as the ceiling. On these shelves were
piled dry-goods of all grades and material, lamps,
shoes, harness, hardware, canned goods of every
description, crackers, soap, starch, axle grease,
false hair, perfume, patent medicines, toys, paint
brushes, brooms, tobacco, writing paper, china
and glass ware, jars, pots and pans, pokers, baseball
bats, millinery, overalls, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The things that were too tall for the shelves,
like Grandfather's clock, consequently stood on
the floor. The aisle between the counters was
blocked with sewing machines, kitchen tables,
chairs, lawn mowers, crates of eggs and cases of
ginger ale and sarsaparilla. There were barrels
of coarse salt and great tins of lard, firkins of
mackerel and herring, barrels of flour and sacks
of meal. One would think that everything in
the world that could be bought or sold was in that
little store, but no! A door to one side led into
another room and this room was also full to overflowing.
There were more barrels of provisions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for man and beast; sacks of chicken feed and
bran; stoves of all kinds; poultry netting; coils
of wire fencing; gardening implements and away
back in a corner I spied a coffin.</p>

<p>What a setting for such a jewel as Annie
Pore! Her beauty shone resplendent from its
background of apron gingham and butter crocks.
I fancied I could detect a little redness to her
eyelids as though the disappointment in not being
at Maxton with her friends had caused some
weeping, but her manner was calm and her expression
one of resignation to fate and the decrees
of a selfish father. I could not help thinking
how I would have behaved under the circumstances,
or the Tucker twins. I would not have
cried, to be sure, but neither would my expression
have been resigned. As for Dum and Dee: they
would no doubt have broken up the shop.</p>

<p>"We are so sorry Annie can't come to the
house-party," I ventured as the farmer who had
been haggling for the rake decided not to take it.</p>

<p>Why Mr. Pore was ever able to sell anything
I could not see. His manner was so superior and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
condescending. Harvie told me afterwards that
Mr. Pore had succeeded in spite of himself. He
was scrupulously honest in the first place and
then he always carried the best line of goods. As
for the science of salesmanship: he had yet to
learn its rudiments. He looked sore and irritated
at having failed to make the sale but put
on more than ever the manner of insulted royalty.
I saw the farmer making for the rival store
where a little later he emerged. Blinker had
made the sale.</p>

<p>When I ventured the above remark, Annie
looked as though she wished I wouldn't, and her
father, I am sure, regretted the fact that I was
part English, and that English of good blood;
otherwise he could easily have annihilated me.</p>

<p>"It is a matter I do not care to discuss," he
said with a freezing hauteur.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not discussing with you, my dear
Mr. Pore! I am merely telling you. All of us
are so devoted to Annie and we have looked forward
to being with her on this house-party all
summer. I am sure if Harvie had known earlier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that you would not be able to spare Annie at this
time, he would have been glad to postpone the
party."</p>

<p>"Ahem&mdash;I&mdash;am compelled to take this occasion
for a business trip. When one is engaged in
mercantile pursuits, it is necessary to make periodical
visits to the city to replenish one's wares."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, I understand, but we still are
dreadfully sorry about Annie. Of course we
know that you want her to have all the pleasure
on earth. That is the way fathers are made.
We are sure you will make your stay as brief as
possible so that Annie can join us at Maxton."</p>

<p>He looked somewhat taken aback and murmured
something more about mercantile pursuits.
Sleepy sat on a keg of nails with eyes as
big as saucers while Annie had the startled expression
of one who sees her friend enter the cage
of a man-eating lion.</p>

<p>"You see I am an only child, too, Mr. Pore,
and my mother is dead, just like Annie's. I
know better than anyone how much a father can
be to a little motherless daughter, and how that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
father can plan and deny himself for his child.
You can't tell me anything about the love of a
father."</p>

<p>As Mr. Pore had never attempted to tell of
any such thing, this was most audacious of me.
Annie was actually gasping and Sleepy choked,
but Mr. Pore looked at me quite solemnly
through his gold-rimmed glasses.</p>

<p>"Sometimes my father is called away; you see
a country doctor's time is not his own, either, and
he has had to leave me just when I felt I most
needed him&mdash;on birthdays&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;all kinds
of holidays, but he comes back to me just as fast
as he can. My father is thinking of getting an
assistant and then he can have more time, I hope.
You have had an assistant, too, have you not?"</p>

<p>He bowed gravely.</p>

<p>"Where is he, then?"</p>

<p>"He is away on leave."</p>

<p>"Ill? That is too bad!"</p>

<p>"No, not ill! He is having a much-needed
holiday."</p>

<p>"Oh, then he has gone on a trip?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fancy not."</p>

<p>"Why, then I am sure he would be glad to
come back and relieve Annie so she can come to
Maxton. Oh, Mr. Pore, do please write for him
to come on back and take his holiday later!"</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Allison&mdash;&mdash;" he began in his
most dignified Oxford donnish manner.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just know you will! You and Father
and Mr. Tucker are all just alike. You can't
bear to deny your girls any pleasure."</p>

<p>His expression was comical at having these virtues
thrust upon him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;shall endeavor to return from this
enforced journey, necessary to replenish the
stock which one engaged in mercantile pursuits
in the rural districts finds it expedient to carry,
and on my return if all goes well with the business,
I shall permit my daughter to enjoy the
hospitality extended to her by my neighbor, General
Price."</p>

<p>"I knew you would! I knew you would!"
and I shook his limp hand which Dee Tucker had
once said reminded her of nothing so much as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
old pump handle that had lost the sucker.
Everybody knows how that feels, at least everybody
who has had dealings with pumps. You
grasp the handle expecting some resistance and a
flow of water in response; but when the sucker
has disappeared, the handle will fly up in a
strange limp manner and unless the pumper is
wary there is danger of getting a lick in the nose.</p>

<p>I cared not for a response. If no flow of kindliness
was the result of my enthusiasm, I cared not
a whit. Annie was to be one of the house-party
and I had saved the day. I remembered how
Mr. Tucker, dear old Zebedee, had declared that
he had won over Mr. Pore by treating him like a
human being, that time he had persuaded him to
let Annie come to Willoughby to the vacation
party. I had treated him as I would any ordinary
kind father and he had been so astonished
and pleased at his portrait that he had unconsciously
accepted it as a likeness and begun to
pose to look like it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ENGAGING IN MERCANTILE PURSUITS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A warning</span> whistle from the up-going steamboat
made the dignified Mr. Pore step lively.
With admonitions to Annie to keep an eye to
business and with a limp handshake to Sleepy
and me, a peck of a kiss on Annie's white brow,
he seized his ancient Gladstone bag and made for
the landing. That bag must have been a leftover
from the old days in England, and more
precious it was in its owner's eyes than the finest
new suitcase that money might buy.</p>

<p>All of us were relieved that he was gone. I
giggled with joy and Annie smiled at Sleepy and
me as she had not done since we arrived.</p>

<p>"All the gang is coming down soon to see you,
honey. They would have come with us but we
slipped off," said I, going behind the counter to
hug my little friend. I always have had a way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of calling Annie my little friend, which is most
absurd as she is inches taller than I am, but there
has been a feeling somehow that she must be protected,
and persons who must be protected seem
little even when they are big.</p>

<p>"Gee, I wish I could take you on a little drive
before they come!" exclaimed Sleepy.</p>

<p>"That is very kind of you but of course I can't
leave the shop," sighed Annie.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can! I am here!"</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't let you keep shop for me,"
laughed Annie.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know why not&mdash;I bet I can sell
more things than you can. Just you try me."</p>

<p>"It isn't that! I just couldn't let you. It is
something I have to do but it is not right for you
to do it."</p>

<p>"Such nonsense! You just put on your hat
and go with Sleepy. How do you know what is
the price of things?"</p>

<p>"Almost all the goods have marks on them but
here is a list of prices, besides,&mdash;but Page, dear,&mdash;I
just couldn't let you do it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you just can!" and I took off my own
hat and put it on her head. I hadn't known before
what a pretty hat it was. Any hat would be
glorified by Annie's wonderful honey-colored
hair. "Now give me your apron!" and I untied
the little frilly affair that Annie wore to keep
shop in and put it on myself.</p>

<p>Sleepy took her by the arm and carried her off,
protesting, laughing, holding back, but happy in
being coerced.</p>

<p>"Take her for a long drive, Sleepy! I can
run this store and sell it out of supplies in no
time, I am sure."</p>

<p>I heard the sound of the red wheels of the
spruce little buggy die away as the driver let the
young horse have free rein. I gave a sigh of joy.
Here I was keeping store at last! What would
Mammy Susan say? It is not often that the
acme of one's ambition is reached so young. I
smoothed down my apron and slipped in behind
the counter just as a customer entered.</p>

<p>It was a farmer's wife who had driven over to
the landing for provisions. She hitched her horse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and ramshackle buggy in front of the store and
came in prepared to spend a delightful hour.
Going to the store in the country is the event of
the week. Her eye had an eager gleam and there
was a flush on her high cheek bones. She was a
gaunt-looking woman with hair slicked up so
tight under her stiff straw hat that it looked as
though it must hurt. The hat had all the flowers
that grow in an old-fashioned garden bedecking
it, to say nothing of spiky bows of green ribbon
and a rhinestone buckle. She had on a linen
duster which had evidently been hastily donned
over a calico house dress.</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Pore?"</p>

<p>"He has gone to Richmond."</p>

<p>"Where's Annie?"</p>

<p>"She has stepped out for a moment. Please
may I serve you?"</p>

<p>"No, I reckon I'll come again when some of
them are in. I'll go over to Blinker's and trade
this morning."</p>

<p>Heavens! Was I to stand still and see customers
go over to the rival store? Had I missed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
my vocation after all my dreams? Was storekeeping
not what I was cut out for?</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you won't stay and see these new
ginghams," I faltered. A gleam in her eye emboldened
me to proceed. "They are making
them up so pretty in Richmond now."</p>

<p>"Well, I wonder if they are! Are you from
Richmond?"</p>

<p>"I have been visiting there but I am from
Milton. I love to visit in Richmond. Don't
you? It is such a good way to get the new
styles."</p>

<p>That had fetched her. She gave up all idea of
trading with Blinker. What did he know of
styles and the way ginghams were being made
up in the city? I got down stacks of dry-goods
and with my first customer began to plan a wonderful
garment for the protracted meeting soon
to take place. Gingham was decided not to be
fine enough for the occasion and a pretty piece of
voile was chosen instead. A silk drop skirt must
go with it and bunches of velvet ribbon must set
it off. The farmer's wife was having the time of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
her life and I was enjoying myself to the utmost.
I measured off the material in a most professional
manner, trembling for fear the customer
would find out what a novice I was. I was
thankful that she was to make it instead of me.
With all of my learned talk about clothes, I could
not have sewed up a pillowslip and had it fit the
pillow.</p>

<p>Next on the program was chicken feed. The
rats had devoured her supply of wheat saved for
the poultry and the corn had not yet been harvested.
We had to go in the adjoining room for
that and I had a chance to peep at my price list
on the way. I persuaded her also into laying in
a supply of canned soups and got her interested
in a lawn mower and a patent churn. She declared
she was coming over the next day with her
husband and try to persuade him to purchase
both of them for her.</p>

<p>"Men-folks are mighty slow to get implements
for the women. I ain't complaining of my old
man, but he thinks he must have every new-fangled
bit of farming machinery that comes along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
while I am churning with the same old big-at-the-bottom-and-little-at-the-top-little-thing-in-the-middle-goes-flippityflop
churn that my mother
had. As for the bit of lawn around the house
that he 'lows me,&mdash;that has to be cut with a sickle
just when I can catch a hand to do it. Now if I
had that little lawn mower I could run it myself
and keep things kind of tidy like 'round the
house."</p>

<p>"Of course you could," I assented. "Now
don't you want some of this cheese? It is right
fresh." I had noted a great new cheese in a glass
case that had evidently been cut only that morning.
"Do you ever make polenta? This cheese
would be fine for that."</p>

<p>"No, do tell! I never even heard of it."</p>

<p>"Why, it is a great dish among the Italians
and is the best thing you ever tasted."</p>

<p>"I'm a great hand for cooking and sho' do
relish a new recipe."</p>

<p>"Take three cups of boiling water and one cup
of corn meal and one cup of grated cheese, and a
teaspoon of salt. Stir the meal into the boiling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
water and let it cook until it begins to get thick
and then put in the cheese and salt and bake it in
a well-greased pan. It is dandy eating."</p>

<p>"Well now, doesn't that sound nice? Give
me a pound of the cheese and one of those new
pans to bake it in. My pans are all pretty nigh
burnt out."</p>

<p>"Did you ever try any of this glassware for
baking? It is so nice and clean and the crust
looks so pretty showing through. To be sure it
is more expensive than tin, but it is so satisfactory."</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing! Show it to
me."</p>

<p>I had noticed with some surprise that Mr. Pore
had a supply of the fire-proof glass just coming
into general use. He was certainly a progressive
buyer for one who was such a poor salesman. I
sold her two glass baking dishes and then more
dry-goods. It took three trips for us to carry
out all her packages to the buggy. More purchasers
had arrived in the meantime. I foresaw
a busy time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>A little colored girl with three eggs tied up in a
rag wanted to trade them for flour.</p>

<p>"My maw is makin' a cake fur the barsket
fun'ral an' she ain't got a Gawd's mouth er flour
in the house. She say if'n she can trade these
here fur some flour she'll be jes' a-kitin'."</p>

<p>"Whar you git them aigs?" asked an old uncle
suspiciously. I had just sold him a plug of
"eatin' terbaccer."</p>

<p>"I git 'em out'n the nesses, whar they b'long,"
she asserted, tossing her wrapped plaits scornfully.</p>

<p>"Yer ain't got but one hen an' I done see yo'
maw a-wringing her naick this ve'y mawnin'."</p>

<p>"What'n if'n yer did? That ole blue hen been
layin' two three times er day lately, an' my maw
she says she mus' about laid out by this time, so
she up'n kilt her fer the barsket fun'ral goin' on
at de same time of de big meetin'. But laws
a mussy! Do you know she was that full er aigs
that it war distressful?" The child's eyes were
wistful at the remembrance.</p>

<p>"Well, well! Nobody can't tell 'bout women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
an' hens. It seems lak nobody don't speak up
an' testify how much good they is in some sisters
'til they is dead an' gone. Same way with hens!
Same way with hens! Is yo' maw gwinter bile it
or bake it?"</p>

<p>"Sh'ain't 'cided. If'n yer bile it yer gits soup
extry an' if'n yer bake it yer gits stuffin' an'
graby."</p>

<p>I was thankful for the little training I had in
mathematics when it was up to me to convert
eggs into flour. Some problem! I put in a little
extra flour to make sure and the child skipped
off.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Tucker twins, Mary Flannagan,
and a troop of young men from Maxton
blew in. I was secretly relieved that Miss Wilcox
was not of the party. Not that I minded
her seeing me keep store, but I had a feeling she
might be a little scornful of Annie Pore.</p>

<p>"Where is Annie?" cried Dum.</p>

<p>"We are nearly dead to see her," declared
Dee.</p>

<p>"Gone driving with Sleepy. I am keeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
store in her absence. His Lord High Muck-a-Muck
has embarked for Richmond."</p>

<p>"What fun! What fun! We bid to help!"</p>

<p>"Maybe only one had better help, as purchasers
coming in might be overcome by too
many clerks," I laughed.</p>

<p>"You are right! Dee must be the one because
she is so tactful," said Dum magnanimously.</p>

<p>So Dee took off her hat and got behind the
candy and ginger ale side of the counter, and
then such a buying and selling ensued as that
country store had never witnessed.</p>

<p>Of course everybody treated everybody else
and then had to be treated in turn. I stayed on
the dry-goods side, and while I was not doing
such a thriving business as Dee, still I had my
hands full. The farmer's wife had met some acquaintances
and sent them to Pore's to see the
new clerk who could tell them so much about
Richmond styles. I had to draw a gallon of
kerosene for one customer, but Wink insisted
upon doing this for me. I did not want him
to one little bit. If I was to be storekeeper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
I preferred being one, not just playing at
it.</p>

<p>"I think you are wonderful, Page, to do this
for Annie," he whispered to me as we made our
way to the coal oil barrel.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! What is wonderful about it?"</p>

<p>"You are always kind to everybody but me."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to keep store for you?"</p>

<p>"No, I want you to keep house for me," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"But I did not know you had a house," I
teased.</p>

<p>He pumped vigorously at the coal oil.</p>

<p>"I intend to have one some day."</p>

<p>"A grand one, surely, if you expect to have a
housekeeper!"</p>

<p>"Page, you know what I mean!" He looked
longingly into my eyes that I knew were full of
mischievous twinkles.</p>

<p>"All I know is, you have wasted about a quart
of kerosene."</p>

<p>The floor was flooded. It is a difficult thing to
pump coal oil and make love at the same time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Poor Wink had done both of his jobs badly. He
looked aghast at the havoc he had caused.</p>

<p>"I am a bungling fool!" he cried.</p>

<p>"No, Wink, you are not that. You are just
not an adept at&mdash;pumping coal oil."</p>

<p>"Why are you always different with me?
You don't treat other fellows the way you do
me."</p>

<p>"You don't treat other girls the way you do
me," I retorted.</p>

<p>"Of course not! I don't feel towards them as
I do towards you."</p>

<p>"Well, it is a good thing your feelings don't
make you grouchy with everybody. You just
exude gloom as soon as you get with me. But
this isn't keeping shop for Annie," and I grabbed
the oil can from him and ran back into the store.</p>

<p>I was very glad to see Wink make his way to
Dee. He usually went to her after a bout with
me. They were great friends and seemed to
have a million things of interest to discuss and
nothing to disagree about. I could have been
just as good a friend to him if he had only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
dropped the eternal subject and treated me as he
did Dee: like an ordinary girl who was ready for
a good time but had no idea of a serious attachment.
We were nothing but chits of girls, after
all, and only out of school because Gresham happened
to burn down before we had time to graduate.</p>

<p>"Umm! How you do smell of coal oil!"
cried Dee. "Don't dare to touch anything in
my line of groceries until you have washed your
hands. There's a basin back there."</p>

<p>Wink laughed and washed his hands as commanded.
Now if I had said to him what Dee
had he would have been furious, and gloom impenetrable
would have ensued.</p>

<p>That afternoon I cut off and planned four different
dresses for four farmers' wives, selling
trimming and ribbons and fancy buttons. I
made many trades with persons bringing in eggs
and chickens and carrying off various commodities
in exchange. I was never so busy in my life.
Dee was equally so, even after we had persuaded
the noisy crowd from Maxton to depart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Goodness! I feel as though I had been serving
at a church fair," cried Dee, sinking down
exhausted on a soap box.</p>

<p>She had just wheedled a shy young farmer into
thinking that existence could not continue without
a box of scented soap and a new cravat, although
he had made a trip to the store for nothing
more ornate than salt for the cattle.</p>

<p>"How do you reckon Annie ever gets through
the day if this one is a sample? I haven't
stopped a minute and here come some more
traders."</p>

<p>The fact was that Dee and I had done about
three times as much selling as the Pores usually
accomplished. Word had gone forth that we
were keeping shop, and everybody hastened to
the country store. Dee found this out by accident
over the telephone. There was such a violent
ringing of the bell that she hastened to answer
it, not being on to the country 'phone where
everybody's bell rings at every call. This is what
she overheard:</p>

<p>"Say, Milly! Pore's have got some gals from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Richmond clerking there. They can put you on
to the styles."</p>

<p>"So I hear! I'm gettin' the mule hitched up
fast as I can to go over."</p>

<p>And then a masculine voice took it up evidently
from another section:</p>

<p>"They say they are peaches, too!"</p>

<p>"That you, Dick Lee? Where'd you hear
about them?"</p>

<p>"Saw Lem Baker on the way, goin' for salt.
He got it from Jim Cullen."</p>

<p>"I bet you'll be there soon yourself," broke in
the voice of Milly.</p>

<p>"Sure! My car is already cranked up gettin'
up speed for the run. S'long!"</p>

<p>"Wait! What you goin' to buy, Dick? Your
sister told me you went to the store yesterday and
laid in enough for a week."</p>

<p>"Well, I may get a coffin," laughed the gay
voice of Dick as he hung up the receiver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DEE TUCKER MAKES A SALE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Page!</span> I've been eavesdropping! I declare
I never meant to do it. I got into the swim of
the conversation and somehow couldn't get out of
it," cried Dee, blushing furiously. "I don't
know what Zebedee would say if he knew it."</p>

<p>"Why, honey, that isn't eavesdropping!" I
laughed. "Country people always listen to
everything they can over the 'phone. That is the
only way we have of spreading the news. I can
assure you that perfectly good church members
in our county make a practice of running to the
telephone every time a neighbor's bell rings.
How many were on the line when you cut in?"</p>

<p>"Three or four, I should say, I couldn't quite
tell."</p>

<p>Then Dee told me the conversation she had
overheard, making me a party to the crime of
eavesdropping.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here comes Dick now, I do believe. He
was the one who was all cranked up ready to
come."</p>

<p>There was a great buzzing and hissing on the
road as a disreputable looking Ford came speeding
down the hill. I have never seen such a dilapidated
car, and still it ran and made good
time, too. There was not a square inch of paint
left on its faithful sides, and the top was hanging
down on one side, giving it the appearance of a
broken-winged crow. The doors flapped in the
breezes, and the mud-guards were bent and
twisted as though they had had many a collision.</p>

<p>Dick, however, was spruce enough to make up
for the appearance of his car. He had on a
bright blue suit, the very brightest blue one can
imagine coming in any material but glass or
china; a necktie made of a silk U. S. flag, with a
scarf pin which looked very like an owl with two
great imitation ruby eyes; but I found on inspection
it was the American Eagle. His shoes were
very gay yellow and his socks striped red and
white, carrying out the color scheme of his cravat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>I ducked behind my side of the counter leaving
the field clear for Dee. She stood to her guns
and gave the newcomer a radiant smile. She was
there to sell goods for Annie Pore and sell them
she would.</p>

<p>"Evenin'!"</p>

<p>"How do you do? What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Pretty day!"</p>

<p>"Yes, fine! Is there something I can show
you?"</p>

<p>"Not so warm as yesterday and a little bit
cooler than the day before!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so. We've got in a fresh
cheese,&mdash;maybe you would like a few pounds of
it."</p>

<p>"Looks like rain but the moon hangs dry."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope it won't rain,&mdash;but maybe it will&mdash;let
me sell you an umbrella,&mdash;they are great
when it rains."</p>

<p>"We don't to say need rain for most of the
crops, but it wouldn't hurt the late potatoes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad of that!"</p>

<p>"But the watermelons don't need a drop more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
They are ripening fine,&mdash;rain would make them
too mushy like. I'm going to ship a load of them
next week. I 'low I'll get about three hundred
off of that sandy creek bottom."</p>

<p>"Fine! Watermelons are my favorite berry."</p>

<p>Right there I exploded and the young man let
out a great haw! haw! too that helped to break
the ice, and also enabled Dee to stop her painful
rejoinders to his polite small talk, and then he
began to buy. I heard Annie and Sleepy as
they hitched the horse at the post and I hoped devoutly
the festive Dick would buy out the store
before they got in.</p>

<p>Already he had purchased six cravats, a new
coal skuttle, a much-decorated set of bedroom
china, a bag of horse cakes, some canned salmon
and a box of axle grease when Annie made her
appearance.</p>

<p>She was looking so lovely that I did not blame
Sleepy for having the expression of a hungry
man. She was certainly good enough to eat.</p>

<p>"Oh, Page, we had such a wonderful drive! I
am so afraid we were gone too long, but George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
simply would not turn around." Annie was the
only person who always called Sleepy by his
Christian name.</p>

<p>"He was quite right. I have had the time of
my life. Dee is helping me. She is in the other
room now, selling a young man named Dick
everything in the store. Don't butt in on her;
let her finish her sales. Here come the others!
They said they would be back to see you."</p>

<p>In came all the house-party and such a hugging
and kissing and handshaking ensued as I
am sure that little country store had never before
witnessed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Annie, we miss you so!" cried Mary.</p>

<p>"Indeed we do!" from the others.</p>

<p>"Maybe I can be with you in a day or so," said
Annie. "Father is going to try to return in a
very little while."</p>

<p>"Well, until he does come back one of us is
going to be with you every day," declared Dum.
"Page and Dee need not think they are the only
ones who are going to help."</p>

<p>Annie's eyes were full of happy tears. "What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
have I done to deserve so many dear friends?"
she whispered to me.</p>

<p>"Nothing but just be your sweet self!" I answered.
"I must peep in and see what Dee is
doing to that poor defenseless Dick. I bet she
has sold him a kitchen stove by this time."</p>

<p>Annie and I made our way into the outer room,
where at the far end we could see Dick and Dee
in earnest converse.</p>

<p>"It is a very excellent one," she was declaiming.
"In fact, I am sure there is not a better one
to be bought. It is air tight and water tight; of
the best material; the latest style; the workmanship
on it is very superior; the price is ridiculously
low. Really I think all country people
ought to have one in the house for emergencies.
One never can tell when one will be needed and
sometimes they are so difficult to get in a hurry."</p>

<p>"That's so!" agreed the enamored Dick.
"But I reckon I could get this any time from old
man Pore if I should need it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! You see this is the only one in stock
and somebody might come for this this very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
night, and then where would you be if you
needed it? Then even if you could get another
one, it might not be nearly so attractive as this
one. They are going up, too, all the time,&mdash;effect
of the war. Of course this was bought when
they were not so high, and I am letting you have
advantage of the price we paid for it. After this
they will be up at least forty per cent.&mdash;that's the
truth. The war prices are something fierce."</p>

<p>"Ain't it the truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and then you might not be able to get
another lavender one. I just know lavender
would be becoming to you. I'd like to see you in
a lavender one."</p>

<p>"Would you really now? That settles it then!
I'll have to get old Pore to trust me, though, until
I sell my melons."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right. Just whenever you feel
like paying."</p>

<p>I was completely mystified. What on earth
was that ridiculous girl selling to the young
farmer? Annie was reduced to the limpness of
a wet dishrag by what we had overheard. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
giggles had her in their clutches and she could not
speak.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can help me out with it?"
asked the young man.</p>

<p>"Sure! It is not heavy yet."</p>

<p>Around the labyrinth made by the farming
implements, stoves, etc., came the buyer and
seller, he backing and she carefully guiding him.
Between them they carried a long something; I,
at first, could not make out what.</p>

<p>"A coffin!" I gasped.</p>

<p>Through the door they made their way into the
store proper. Some colored customers had just
come in and these fell back with expressions of
curiosity and awe equally mingled on their black
faces.</p>

<p>"Who daid? Who daid?" they whispered,
but no one vouchsafed any information. Dee
looked supernaturally solemn and Dick only
wanted to get his latest purchase safely landed in
his car.</p>

<p>The house-party had adjourned to the porch
in front, and when the lugubrious procession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
emerged from the store the gaiety suddenly
ceased. As Dick backed out, the young men
doffed their caps and the girls bowed their heads.
What was their amazement when Dee turned out
to have hold of the other end. Every man sprang
forward to take her place, but she sadly shook her
head and held on to her job.</p>

<p>"It isn't heavy," she whispered.</p>

<p>Dum's eyes filled with tears. She thought
with sadness that in a short while it would be
heavy when it fulfilled its destiny. She was very
proud of her twin that she should be so kind
and helpful at such a time. How like Dee
it was to be assisting this poor young man, who
had perhaps lost some one near and dear to
him!</p>

<p>No one spoke, but all remained reverently uncovered
while the coffin was hoisted on the back
seat of the ragged old car. The young men assisted
in this, although Dee would not resign her
place as chief mourner.</p>

<p>"Who daid? Who daid?" clamored the darkies
who seemed to spring up from the ground,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
such a crowd of them appeared in the twinkling
of an eye.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Dum in a teary voice,
"but isn't it sad?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't Miss Rena Lee 'cause I jes' done
seed her headin' fer the sto'," declared a little
pickaninny.</p>

<p>"She ain't a-trus'in' her bones ter Mr. Dick's
artermobe. She done sayed she gonter dribe her
ole yaller mule whar she gwinter go."</p>

<p>"Ain't de Lees got a boardner? Maybe it's de
boardner," suggested a helpful old woman.</p>

<p>"Well, I wonder if it is! Here he come! I'm
a-gwinter arsk him."</p>

<p>Dick came out laden with his other purchases.</p>

<p>"Lawsamussy! It mus' be de boardner an' all
er her folks is a-comin' down, 'cause how come
Mr. Dick hafter buy all them things otherwise?
Look thar chiny an' coal skuttles an' what not!"</p>

<p>"Who daid, Mr. Dick? Who daid?"</p>

<p>"Nobody I know of!" grinned the young man.</p>

<p>"Ain't it de boardner?"</p>

<p>"What boarder?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Rena's boardner!"</p>

<p>"Sister Rena hasn't any boarder that I know
of. Here, get out of the road or I'll let you
know who is dead!"</p>

<p>He took a fond farewell of Dee and cranking
up his noisy car, he jumped to his seat and
speeded home with the coffin and the coal skuttle
bouncing up and down right merrily.</p>

<p>"Ain't nobody daid?" grieved a sad old
woman.</p>

<p>"No! Nobody ain't daid!" snapped an old
man. "Nobody ain't eben a-dyin'. Now that
thar Dick Lee done bought up th' only carsket
in the sto' an' my Luly is mighty low&mdash;mighty
low."</p>

<p>"Sho-o' nuf I ain't heard tell of it. Is she in
de baid?"</p>

<p>"Well, not ter say in de baid&mdash;but on de baid,
on de baid. Anyhow 'tain't safe to count on her
fer long. White folks is sho' graspin' these days.
They is sho' graspin'."</p>

<p>The old man departed on his way grumbling.</p>

<p>"Caroline Tucker, what did you sell that coffin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to that young man for?" demanded Dum
sternly.</p>

<p>"Just to see if I could, Virginia Tucker. I
told him I'd like to see him in a coffin lined with
lavender, and he was so complimented, he immediately
bought it to keep for a rainy day."</p>

<p>Dee and I had made so many sales that Annie
had to send a telegram informing her father of
the diminished stock. It was necessary to order
another coffin immediately in case the ailing Luly
might need it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE HUMAN FLY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">General Price</span> was vastly amused over the
account of Dee's sale of the coffin to the amiable
Dick. Miss Maria was frankly shocked, and
Miss Wilcox amazed and a little scornful.</p>

<p>"I never cared for slumming," she announced
that night when we had retired to the girls' wing.</p>

<p>"But helping Annie Pore keep store is not
slumming," said Dee, the dimple in her chin
deepening.</p>

<p>Dee Tucker had a dimple in her chin just like
her father. When father and daughter got ready
for a fight, those dimples always deepened.</p>

<p>"Most kind of you, I am sure, although that
sort of adventure never appealed to me. I have
taught in the mission school in New York's East
Side, but when the class is over I always leave. I
can't bear to mix with the lower classes. It is all
right to help them but not by mixing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you don't understand,&mdash;Annie Pore is
one of our very best friends. She is not the
lower classes. She is better born than any of us
and prettier and better bred and more accomplished&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! I should like to behold this
paragon."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall behold her all right! She is
going to join us here in a day or so."</p>

<p>Jessie Wilcox looked very much astonished
and quite haughty. She could not understand
the Prices asking such a person to meet her. The
daughter of a country storekeeper was hardly
one whom she cared to know socially. Dee had
gone about it the wrong way to make the spoiled
beauty look with favor on the little English girl:&mdash;prettier,
better born, better bred, indeed! As
for accomplishments: what accomplishments
could a dowdy little country girl have that she
had not?</p>

<p>The Tuckers and Jessie Wilcox were not hitting
it off very well in the great bedroom which
they shared. Dum had declared she would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
move the fluffy finery which was spread out on
her bed and she stuck to her word.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with these duds?"
she asked rather brusquely.</p>

<p>"Oh, you just put them back in my trunk,"
drawled the spoiled roommate.</p>

<p>"Humph! You had better ring for your
maid. I'm not much on doing valet work."</p>

<p>With that she caught hold of the four corners
of the bedspread and with a yank deposited the
whole thing adroitly on the floor, butter side up.</p>

<p>Dee told me afterwards that Jessie's expression
was one of complete astonishment. She was
not used to being treated like the common herd.
Much Dum cared! She got into the great four-posted
bed with perfect unconcern, while Dee
tactfully helped the pouting Jessie to hang up
her many frocks.</p>

<p>"She had better be glad I didn't go to bed on
them," stormed the unrepentant Dum when she
told me about it. "As for Dee: I was disgusted
with her for being so mealy-mouthed. Catch me
hanging up anybody's clothes! I bet you one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
thing,&mdash;I bet you she keeps her fripperies off my
bed after this."</p>

<p>I was in a way sorry for Jessie. I know it
must be hard to be a spoiled darling turned loose
with the Tucker twins. They were always perfectly
square and fair in all their dealings, but
they demanded squareness and fairness in others.
Jessie was evidently accustomed to being waited
on and admired, and the Tuckers refused to do
either of these things necessary for the happiness
of their roommate. She had always chosen her
friends with a view to setting off her own charms,
girls who were homely, less vivacious, duller. It
did not suit her at all to be outshone in any way.
She was certainly the prettiest girl in the house-party,
that is, before Annie arrived, but she was
not the most attractive. There never were more
delightful girls in all the world than the Tucker
twins, witty, charming, vivacious, and very handsome.
I could see their development in the two
years I had known them and realized that they
were growing to be very lovely women.</p>

<p>Mary Flannagan was nobody's pretty girl but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
she had something better than beauty, at least
something that proves a better asset in life: extreme
good nature and a sense of humor that embraced
the whole universe. She had humor
enough to see a joke on herself and take it.
That, to me, is the quintessence of humor.
Wherever Mary was there also were laughter
and gaiety. She had a heart as big as all Ireland,
from which country she had inherited her
wit as well as her name.</p>

<p>Mary was not quite so bunchy as she had been.
Two years had stretched her out a bit, but she
would always be something of a rolypoly. She
was as active as a cat, and so determined was she
to end up as a character movie actress she never
stopped her limbering-up exercises. After I
would get in bed at night she would begin. She
would turn somersaults, stand on her head, walk
on her hands, do cart-wheels, bend the crab, fall
on the floor at full length and do a hundred other
wonderful stunts.</p>

<p>"I am so plain I'll have to go in for slap-stick
comedy and maybe work up to the legit., but go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in I will. Why, Page, there is oodlums of money
in movies and think of the life!"</p>

<p>"I can see you, Mary, as a side partner to
Douglas Fairbanks. Can you climb up a wall
like a fly?" I laughed.</p>

<p>"No-o, not yet but soon! I can't get much
practice in wall scaling. I am dying to try this
wall outside our window. It is covered with ivy
and would be easy as dirt, I know," and she
poked her head out the window, gazing longingly
at the tempting perpendicularity of the wall beneath.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Hawkins, alias Shorty, thought
Mary was just about the best chum a fellow could
have, and great was his joy when Fate landed
him at the same country house with the inimitable
Mary. Shorty, too, had made out to grow a bit
since first we saw him make the great play in the
football game at Hill Top. He was a very engaging
lad with his tousled mane, rosy cheeks and
clear boy's eyes.</p>

<p>"Is Shorty going to get into the movies, too?"
I teased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"No,&mdash;navy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, how splendid! I didn't know he had decided."</p>

<p>"Yes! He has talked to me a lot about it,"
said Mary quite soberly.</p>

<p>"What do you think about it?"</p>

<p>"Me? Why, I think our navy is going to
have to be enlarged and I can't think of anybody
better suited to it than Shorty. He is a descendant
of Sir John Hawkins, you know, and that
means seafaring blood in his veins."</p>

<p>How little did Mary and I think, as we lay in
that great four-post bed and wisely discussed
preparedness, that our country would really be
at war in not so very many months, and that
Shorty's entering the navy would be a very serious
matter to all of his friends, if not to him.</p>

<p>No thoughts of war were disturbing us. The
great war was going on, but then we were used to
that and we were too young and thoughtless for
it to bother us. It was across the water and no
one we knew personally was implicated. Maxton
was too peaceful a spot for one to realize that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
such a thing as bloodshed could go on anywhere
in all the world. Our great room with its two
huge beds and massive wardrobe, bureau and
washstand, had once sheltered Washington and
later on Lafayette; and then as the ages had
rolled by, General Lee had visited the Prices and
had slept in the very bed where Mary and I were
lying so sagely and smugly arguing for preparedness.
Perhaps the mocking-bird that every
now and then gave forth a silvery trill in the holly
tree near our window was descended from the
same mocking-bird that no doubt had sung to the
great warrior as he lay in the four-poster.</p>

<p>How quiet it was! A whippoorwill gave an
occasional cry away off in the woods, and once I
heard the chugging of a small steamboat puffing
its way up the river, and then a little later the
swish swash on the shore of the waves made by
the stern wheel. But for that, the night was absolutely
still.</p>

<p>"Page," whispered Mary, "are you asleep?"</p>

<p>"Fortunately not, or I'd be awake," I laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking about getting up and trying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
scale that wall. I am 'most sure I could do it
with all that ivy to dig my toes in."</p>

<p>"Why don't you wait until morning?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't want an audience. It is best
to practice these stunts without anyone looking."</p>

<p>"Suppose you fall!"</p>

<p>"That's something movie actresses have to expect.
I won't fall far if I do fall."</p>

<p>"Will you mind if I look on?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! I can pretend you are the director."</p>

<p>Everything was as quiet as the grave when
Mary bounced out of bed to practice her stunt.
I followed, nothing loath to see more of the wonderful
night. Some nights are too beautiful to
waste in sleeping. It has always seemed such a
pity to me that we could not fill up on sleep in
disagreeable weather, and then when a glorious
moonlight night arrives, be able to draw on
that reserve fund of sleep and just sit up all
night.</p>

<p>"Isn't it splendid out on the lawn? And only
look at the river in the moonlight. I'd certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
like to be out there in a boat this minute with
some very nice interesting person to recite poetry
to me," I mused.</p>

<p>"I heard Wink White begging you to take a
row with him."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I see myself doing it."</p>

<p>"Don't you like him?" asked Mary, sitting in
the window ready for the trial descent.</p>

<p>"Of course I like him, but he's such a goose."</p>

<p>"Shorty thinks he is grand."</p>

<p>"So he is&mdash;grand, gloomy, and peculiar. If
he'd only not be so sad and lonesome when he is
with me."</p>

<p>"Of course all of us have noticed how different
he is with you, never laughing and joking as he
does with us but sighing like a furnace. But
here goes! This is no time for analyzing the
character of young Doctor Stephen White,&mdash;this
is a play of action."</p>

<p>"But, Mary, ought you try to climb down in
your nighty? It might get tangled around your
feet."</p>

<p>"Oh, but the movie ladies always have to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
out of windows in their nighties. I must practice
in costume to get used to it."</p>

<p>"Barefooted, too?"</p>

<p>"Of course! I need all these toes to hang on
by. Next time I am going to have my ch-e-i-ild,
but this first time perhaps I had better not try to
carry anything."</p>

<p>"I should think not,&mdash;but, Mary, do be careful."</p>

<p>I was looking down the perpendicular wall and
it began to seem to me to be a crazy undertaking.
The vines were very thick and would no doubt
offer a foot-rest to the daring girl, but suppose
she lost her head or the vine pulled loose from the
wall!</p>

<p>It is a much easier matter to climb up and get
in a window than it is to get out of one and climb
down. There is something very scary about projecting
one's bare foot into the unknown. Mary,
however, was too serious in her desire to perfect
herself for her chosen profession to stop and wiggle
her toes with indecision. She was out of the
window in a moment. I held my breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/house002.png" width="373" height="500" alt="I ALMOST BEAT MARY TO THE GROUND I LEANED SO FAR OUT OF THE WINDOW." title="" />
<span class="caption">I ALMOST BEAT MARY TO THE GROUND I LEANED SO FAR OUT OF THE WINDOW. &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="#Page_74">Page 74.</a></span>
</div>
<p>"Oh, God save her! Oh, God save her!" I
whispered.</p>

<p>"Fireman, save my ch-e-i-ild!" came back in
sibilant tones from Mary.</p>

<p>I couldn't help laughing although I was trembling
with fright. I almost beat Mary to the
ground I leaned so far out of the window. Sometimes
the thick ivy hid her from my sight and
again she would loom out very white in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Down at last! I felt like shouting for joy.
Now began the ascent which was a small matter
compared to the descent.</p>

<p>When the climber was about half-way up, I
suddenly became aware of figures on the edge
of the lawn. "The servants returning from
church," I thought. Harvie had told me that
"big meetin'" was going on and his aunt was
quite concerned about her servants, as they had a
way of taking French leave at "big meetin'"
time. With the house-party in session, a
paucity of servants would be quite serious.
Extra inducements had been offered and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
whole corps had promised to remain, taking
turn about in getting off early for night
church.</p>



<p>Anyone who has lived in the country, where
colored servants are the only ones, knows what a
serious time "big meetin'" can be. The whole
negro population seems to go mad in a frenzy of
religious fervor. Crops that are inconsiderate
enough to ripen at that period remain ungathered;
the washwoman lets soiled clothes pile up
indefinitely; cooks refuse to cook; housemaids
have a soul above sweeping; cows go dry for lack
of milking; horses go uncurried and vehicles unwashed
and ungreased.</p>

<p>I smiled when I saw that straggling group returning
from church, knowing they would not be
fit for any very arduous tasks the next day. I
remembered how Mammy Susan used to berate
our darkies for their delinquencies on days
following meetings. As the churchgoers approached
the house, which they had to pass to
reach the quarters on the other side of the great
house, they suddenly became aware of Mary's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
white figure hanging midway between heaven
and earth.</p>

<p>Shouts and groans arose! One woman fell to
the ground and, regardless of her finery, rolled
on the grass imploring her Maker to save her. I
trembled for fear Mary would fall, but she
clung to the vine and scrambled up and in the
window. The darkies ran like frightened rabbits.</p>

<p>"They thought you were a ghost, I believe."</p>

<p>"Well, I came mighty near giving up the
ghost. When I heard those groans I thought
something had me sure," panted the great actress,
looking ruefully at a long rent in her very best
nighty. "I did it all right, but being a great
movie actress who is to play opposite Douglas
Fairbanks is certainly hard on one's rags. Look,
here's another tear! Another and another! I
did that when the first darky squealed."</p>

<p>Of course we went to bed giggling.</p>

<p>"I wish Tweedles had seen you, but they
would not have been willing to be mere audience.
As for me,&mdash;I have no desire to be classified as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a human fly. I wonder if we will hear some wild
tale from those silly darkies."</p>

<p>But Mary was fast asleep before she could express
her opinion. I could not sleep until I got
the following limerick out of my system:</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Human Fly</span></div>

<div class='poem'>
Our Mary, an actress so flighty,<br />
Scaled a wall in her very best nighty.<br />

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"BIG MEETIN'"</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I awakened</span> early the next morning in spite
of having been manager of a movie studio at all
hours of the night. Mary was sleeping heavily.
After all, I fancy climbing up and down a brick
wall is harder than merely watching someone else
do it. She had a big scratch across her cheek and
her thumb had bled on the pillow. She must
have snagged it on the same nail she had her best
nighty. I peeped out of my eastern window and
found Dum Tucker was doing the same thing
from hers.</p>

<p>"Hello, honey! I'm so glad you're awake,"
she whispered. "Let's dress and go out."</p>

<p>"Is Dee asleep?"</p>

<p>"Sound! And the Lady Jessie is likewise
snoozing, not looking nearly so pretty with her
hair up in curl papers and her face greased with
cold cream. I bet I can beat you dressing!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>We sprang from our doors into the hall at the
same time and feeling sure we were the only ones
awake in all the great mansion, we had the never-to-be-scorned
joy of sliding down the bannisters.
I'd hate to think I could ever get so old I
wouldn't like to slide down bannisters. Of
course I know I shall some day get too old to do
it, but not too old to want to.</p>

<p>We ran out the great back door which opened
on the formal garden.</p>

<p>"My, I'm glad we waked! I was nearly dead
to sit up all night," said Dum.</p>

<p>"Me, too! Mary and I were awake very late.
Did you hear anything?"</p>

<p>"Did I!"</p>

<p>"What did you hear?"</p>

<p>"A strange scratching along the wall,&mdash;I
thought it was a whole lot of snakes climbing up
to our window. There is only one thing in the
world I am afraid of, and that is snakes."</p>

<p>"Mammy Susan says that 'endurin' of the war,
they is sho' to be mo' snakes than in peaceable
times.' Of course she has no idea that this war is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
away off across the water, and if it were inclined
to breed snakes, it wouldn't breed them over here.
But that snake you heard last night was Mary
Flannagan scaling the wall. She is practicing
all the time for the movies."</p>

<p>"Pig, not to call us!"</p>

<p>"I was dying to, but was afraid of raising too
much rumpus."</p>

<p>The garden was beautiful at all times, but at
that early hour it was so lovely it made us gasp.
A row of stately hollyhocks separated the flower
garden from the vegetables. Banked against the
hollyhocks were all kinds of old-fashioned garden
flowers: bachelor's buttons, wall-flowers, pretty-by-nights,
love-in-a-mist, heliotrope, verbena,
etc. There was a thick border of periwinkle
whose glossy dark green leaves enhanced the
brilliancy of the plants beyond. One great
strip was given up entirely to roses,&mdash;and such
roses!</p>

<p>"Gee! This is the life!" cried Dum, kneeling
down among the roses, going kind of mad as
usual over the riot of color. Dum's love of color<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and form amounted to a passion. "Only look at
the shape of this bud and at the color way down
in its heart. Oh, Page, I am so glad we came
out! Only think, this rosebud might have opened
and withered with not a soul seeing it if we had
not happened along:</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"'Full many a gem of purest ray serene</span><br />
The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full many a flower is born to blush unseen</span><br />
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.'"<br />
</div>

<p>"I wonder where the servants are?" I queried.
"At this hour in the country they are usually beginning
to get busy. I tell you, Mammy Susan
has 'em hustling by this time at Bracken."</p>

<p>"I'm hungry as a bear! Don't you think we
might get the old cook to hand us out a crust?"
suggested Dum. "Getting up early always
makes me famished."</p>

<p>"Sure! She is a nice-looking old party and
no doubt would be as pleasant as she looks. Her
name is Aunt Milly."</p>

<p>We made our way to the kitchen, determined
to return to the garden to enjoy the crust or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
whatever the cook might see fit to give us. A
covered way connected the summer kitchen with
the wing of the house where the dining-room was.
This open passage was covered with a lovely old
vine, one not seen in this day and generation except
in old places: Washington's bower. It is a
very thick vine that sends forth great shoots that
fall in a shower like a weeping willow. It has a
dainty little purple blossom that the bees adore,
and these turn later into <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'squshy'">squishy</ins>, bright red
berries. The trunk of this vine is very thick and
sturdy and twists itself into as many fantastic
shapes as a wisteria.</p>

<p>The kitchen was built of logs; in fact it was the
original homestead of the family, having been
erected by the earliest settlers at Price's Landing.
Later on it had been turned into a kitchen
when the mansion had been built. The great old
fireplace with its crane and Dutch oven was still
there, although the cooking was now done on a
modern range. This black abomination of art,
but necessity of the up-to-date housekeeper, was
smoking dismally as we came in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt Milly, please give me a biscuit!" cried
Dum to a fat back bending over the table.</p>

<p>The owner of the back straightened up and
turned. It was not Aunt Milly, but Miss Maria
Price!</p>

<p>"Oh!" was all we could say.</p>

<p>The sedate black-silked and real-laced lady of
the day before presented a sad spectacle when we
made that early morning raid on the Maxton
larder. In place of the handsome black silk she
wore a baggy lawn kimono, and the fine lace cap
had given place to a great mob cap that set off
her moon-like face like a sunflower. Her countenance
was so woebegone that it distressed us
and two great tears were squeezing their way
from her sad eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Price! Please excuse us," I
said, seeing that Dum was speechless.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, it is all right now that you have
seen me out here in this wrapper. These good-for-nothing
darkies have one and all sent me
word they are sick this morning and cannot come
to work, and here I am with no breakfast cooked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
I am so distressed that Harvie's friends should
not be well served. What shall I do? What
shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Do! Why, let all of us help," exclaimed
Dum.</p>

<p>"Let his guests help! Why, my dear, I could
not bear to do such a thing."</p>

<p>"Well, you could bear to let us help a great
deal better than we could bear having you work
yourself to death and let us be idle," said I, putting
my arm around her fat neck, that was just
about the right height to put one's arm around.
Her waist was out of the question, being not only
so low down that I should have had to stoop to
reach it but invisible at that, since it was, as I
have said before, only an imaginary line.</p>

<p>"I have never before in all the fifty years I
have been keeping house at Maxton had to make
a fire. I have done the housekeeping since Ma
died. My sister-in-law, Harvie's grandmother,
was too delicate to keep house, so I have always
done it. I know exactly how things should be
done but I have never had to do them. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
has always been a cook in the kitchen at Maxton.&mdash;This
is the first time.&mdash;And to think it
should come to pass when Harvie's friends are
here. I was opposed to having the house-party
during big meeting. There is never any depending
on the darkies at that time.&mdash;Oh me! Oh
me!"</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Price," I said, placing a chair behind
her and gently pushing her heaving bulk
into it, "you are to sit right here and tell Dum
Tucker and me what to do. We love to do it."</p>

<p>"But, child&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"First, let me pull out the dampers," I suggested,
suiting the action to the word and thereby
stopping the smoking of the range. "Now
mustn't the rolls be made down?" I asked, seeing
a great pan on the table with the lid sitting rakishly
on one side of a huge mass of dough, already
risen beyond its bounds.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me do that. I love to fool with dough."</p>

<p>"But do you know how?"</p>

<p>"Of course I know how."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>After a scrubbing of hands made grubby by a
weed I had pulled up in the garden, I began to
make down the rolls after the manner approved
by Mammy Susan, that most exacting of
teachers.</p>

<p>"Now what can I do?" demanded Dum.</p>

<p>"You must sit still and tell us what next, and
after we get things under way if you want the
other girls to help, I'll call them."</p>

<p>"The breakfast table must be set,&mdash;but, my
dears, I can't bear to have guests working! Such
a thing has never been known at Maxton!"</p>

<p>Dum hastened to the dining-room where she
exercised her own sweet will in the setting of the
table. First she had the joy of cutting a bowl of
roses for the center. She found mats and napkins
in the great old <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Shereton'">Sheraton</ins> sideboard, and
Canton china that Miss Price told her was the
kind to use. The silver was still in the master's
chamber where it was taken every night by the
butler and brought out every morning by that
dignified functionary. I think the non-appearance
of the butler was almost as great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a blow to Miss Price as the defection of the
cook.</p>

<p>"Jasper has been with us since before the war
and the idea of his behaving this way!" she
moaned. "I did not expect anything more from
these flighty maids and the yard boy,&mdash;they have
only been here five or six years,&mdash;but Milly and
Jasper!"</p>

<p>"But maybe they are ill," I said, trying to
soothe her hurt feelings.</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it! How could five
of them get ill at once? More than likely that
trifling Willie, the yard boy, has got religion.
Milly told me he was 'seeking' and I have
known there was something the matter with
him lately, he has been so utterly worthless,"
and our hostess heaved a sigh with which I
could thoroughly sympathize. I well knew
that a "seeking" servant was but a poor excuse.</p>

<p>"How well you do those rolls, my child! Who
taught you?"</p>

<p>Then I told Miss Maria of my old mammy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
who had been mother and teacher and nurse for
me since I was born.</p>

<p>I shaped pan after pan of turnovers and
clover-leaves and put them aside for the second
rising.</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>Miss Maria had decided to give over sighing
and bemoaning, also apologizing for letting us
work. She evidently came to the conclusion that
the headwork had to go on and it was up to her
to get busy in that line, at least. Dum and I
were vastly relieved that she consented to sit still,
as she took up so much room when she moved
around that she retarded our progress quite a
good deal. Seated in a corner by the table, she
could tell us what to do without interrupting
traffic.</p>

<p>Herring must be taken out of soak and prepared
for frying; batter bread must be made; apples
must be fried (she did the slicing); coffee
must be ground; chicken hash must be made after
a recipe peculiar to Maxton, with green peppers
sliced in it and a dash of sherry wine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The cooking part was easy, but keeping up the
fire has always been too much for my limited intelligence.
Wood and more wood must be poked
in the stove at every crucial moment. In the midst
of beating up an omelette one must stop and
pile on more fuel. Peeping in the oven the rolls
may be rising in regular array with a faint blush
of brown appearing on each rounded cheek; the
batter bread may be doing as batter bread should
do: the crust rising up in sheer pride of its perfection
sending forth a delicious odor a little like
popcorn;&mdash;but just then the joy of the vainglorious
cook will take a tumble,&mdash;the fire must
be fed.</p>

<p>"Now is this what you had planned for breakfast,
Miss Maria? You see we have got everything
under way, and if there was anything else
I can do it," I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course no breakfast is really complete
without waffles," sighed the poor lady, "at least,
that is what my brother thinks. He will have to
do without them this morning, though."</p>

<p>"Why? I can make them and bake them!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, child, you must be seated at the table
with the other guests. I could not let you work
so hard."</p>

<p>"But I love to cook! Please let me!"</p>

<p>"All right, but who can bring the hot ones in?
It takes two to serve waffles. I, alas, am too fat
to go back and forth."</p>

<p>"Of course I am going to wait on the table,"
cried Dum, "and when I drop in my tracks, the
other girls can go on with the good work."</p>

<p>"Well, well, what good girls you are! I have
been told that the girls of the present time are
worthless and I am always reading of their being
so inferior to their mothers, but I believe I must
have been misinformed."</p>

<p>"I hope you have been," laughed Dum. "My
private opinion is that we are just about the
same,&mdash;some good and some not so good; some
bad and some not so bad. Anyhow, I am sure
that there is not a girl on this party who would
not be proud to help you, or boy, either, for that
matter."</p>

<p>"We shall have to call the boys to our aid, too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
I am afraid," said Miss Maria, glancing ruefully
at the wood-box. "The wood is low and we
can't cook without wood, eh, Page?"</p>

<p>"Won't I love to see them go to work," and
Dum danced up and down the kitchen waving a
dish-cloth.</p>

<p>The quiet mansion was astir now. The rising
bell had routed the sleepy heads out of their beds,
and from the boys' wing came shouts of the
guests who were playing practical jokes on one
another or merely making a noise from the joy
of living. Dee and Mary found us in the kitchen
and roundly berated us for not calling them in
time to help. Dee reported that Jessie Wilcox
was still in the throes of dressing.</p>

<p>"One of you might go pull some radishes and
wash them and peel them," suggested Miss
Maria.</p>

<p>Dee was off like a flash and came back with
some parsley, too, to dress the dishes.</p>

<p>"Mary, get the ice and see to the water," was
the next command from our general. "I must
go now and put on something besides this old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
wrapper," and our aristocratic hostess sailed to
the house, her lawn wings spread.</p>

<p>Our next visitor was General Price himself,
very courtly and very apologetic and very admiring.
He had just learned of the defection of the
servants when he called for his boots and they
were not forthcoming. Jasper had blacked
his boots and brought them to his door every
morning for half a century, but no Jasper appeared
on that morning. The boots remained
unblacked.</p>

<p>Another duty of the hitherto faithful butler
had been to concoct for his master and the guests
a savory mint julep in a huge silver goblet. This
was sent to the guest chambers and every lady
was supposed to take a sip from the loving cup.
It was never sent to the boys, as General Price
frequently asserted that liquor was not intended
for the youthful male, and that he for one would
never have on his soul that he had offered a drink
to a young man. He seemed to have a different
feeling in regard to the females, thinking perhaps
that beautiful ladies (and all ladies were beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
ladles in his mind) would never take more
than the proffered sip.</p>

<p>On that morning during the big meeting General
Price must make his own julep. This he did
with much pomp and ceremony, putting back
breakfast at least ten minutes while he crushed
ice and measured sugar and the other ingredients
which shall be nameless. A wonderful frost on
the silver goblet was the desired result of the
crushed ice. The mint protruding from the top
of the goblet looked like innocence itself. The
odor of the fresh fruit mingling with the venerable
concoction of rye was delicious enough to
make the sternest prohibitionist regret his principles.</p>

<p>"Now a sip, my dear; the cook must come
first," he said, proffering me the completed work
of art.</p>

<p>"Oh no, General Price! I might not take
even a sip if I am to cook waffles. I might fall
on the stove."</p>

<p>"A sip will do you good, just a sip!" he implored.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>It was good and just a sip did not do me any
harm. I had not the heart to deny the courtly
old man the pleasure of indulging in this rite that
was as much a part of the daily routine as having
his boots blacked and brought to his door or conducting
family prayers.</p>

<p>"Delicious!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"More delicious now than it was," he declared,
"since those rosy lips have touched the brim,"
and then he quoted the following lines with old-fashioned
gallantry:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Drink to me only with thine eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And I will pledge with mine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or leave a kiss but in the cup</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And I'll not look for wine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The thirst that from the soul doth rise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Doth ask a drink divine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But might I of Jove's nectar sup,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I would not change for thine.</span><br />
<br />
"'I sent thee late a rosy wreath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Not so much honoring thee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As giving it a hope that there</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It could not withered be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But thou thereon didst only breathe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And sent'st it back to me;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Not of itself but thee!'"</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>He bowed low and handed me a beautiful rosebud,
the same, I believe, before which Dum had
stood so enthralled earlier in the morning. I
took a long sniff and then pinned it in my hair,
much to the old gentleman's delight.</p>

<p>He turned away to have another fair guest
take the prescribed sip, and that naughty Mary
Flannagan buried her nose in my beautiful rose
and whispered:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"But thou thereon didst only breathe,<br />

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE REASON WHY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> was a very merry breakfast. From my
kitchen fastness I could hear the peals of laughter
as Mary pretended to be a field hand, brought
into the dining-room for the first time, to wait
on the table. I even left my waffles for a moment
to peep in the door. Dee, who was helping with
the waiting, spied me and gave the assembled
company the tip, and before I could get away
they grabbed me and pulled me into the room
where I had to listen to three rousing cheers for
the cook. A batch of waffles burnt up in consequence,
although I ran down the covered way
like Cinderella when the clock struck twelve. A
warning smell of something burning gave me to
understand my time was up.</p>

<p>Baking waffles is a very exciting pastime. The
metamorphosis that batter undergoes in almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a twinkling of an eye into beautiful crisp brown
beauties is a never ending delight and joy to the
cook. With irons just hot enough (and that is
very hot indeed) and batter smooth and thin,
smooth from much beating and thin from much
milk and many eggs, I believe a baker of waffles
can extract as much pure pleasure from her profession
as a great musician can from drawing his
bow across a choice Cremona; or a poet can from
turning out successful verse; or a painter from
watching his picture grow under his skilled
hands.</p>

<p>The house-party was full up at last, and then
the cook and waitress must be seated in the places
of honor and be waited on by the whole crowd.
Not quite all of the crowd, I should have said, as
Jessie was superior to waiting on anybody. She
seemed quite scornful of us for being able to help
Miss Maria.</p>

<p>"I have never been an adept at the domestic
arts," she said somewhat stiffly. "I could not
cook or wash dishes if my life depended on it."</p>

<p>"Humph!" sniffed Dum, "I reckon you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
could if you got good and hungry. Of course
you couldn't do it well, that is, not as well as
Page, for she can't be equalled. As for washing
dishes,&mdash;you can take your first lesson after Page
and Mary and Dee finish breakfast. All of these
dishes have to be washed and there is no one to
do it but the house-party."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess not!" and Jessie looked at her
pretty soft, beringed hands.</p>

<p>"Very well then, you can do the upstairs
work! Beds must be made, you know!"</p>

<p>"Absurd! Do you take me for a housemaid?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't have you for one, but you
might get a job for a few hours before the folks
found out about you."</p>

<p>Dum's tone was rollicking and good-natured.
She seemed to have no idea that she was insulting
the pretty Jessie. It never entered Dum's head
that anyone would shirk a duty that was so apparent
as taking the work of Maxton in hand.</p>

<p>I enjoyed that breakfast very much. Harvie
baked waffles for us and Wink White brought
them in. The young men from Kentucky ran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
back and forth waiting on us, all of them making
more noise and having more collisions than
would have been the case had a regiment been
feeding.</p>

<p>Shorty had already begun to grease the buck-saw
preparatory to sawing up wood for Miss
Maria. He and Rags had volunteered to supply
the fuel. Then the cows must be milked; the
horses curried and fed; in fact, all the farm work
must be done.</p>

<p>I never saw nicer, more considerate boys than
were on that party. They vied with one another
in briskness and efficiency. They wanted to
help us with dishwashing and housework, but
there was enough outside work to keep them
busy, and with all good intentions in the world,
most men-folks are a hindrance rather than a
help when it comes to so-called woman's work.</p>

<p>How we did fly around! Miss Maria got real
gay and giddy in the general whirlwind that
ensued. Dum and Mary undertook to be housemaids,
and such a spreading up of beds and flicking
of dusters was never known. The beds did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
look a little bumpy, but what difference did it
make? The dust they swished off with the
feather dusters settled quietly back on the things,
but why not? Maxton was beautifully kept and
very clean but there is always dust on furniture
in the morning, no matter how well it has been
cleaned the day before. Jessie's bed they left
unmade, declaring that she could sleep in the
same hole for a month before they would even
spread it up for her.</p>

<p>"Lazy piece!" cried Dum. "I actually believe
she does not mean to turn a hair."</p>

<p>That young lady had taken herself off to the
parlor where she was singing in the most operatic
manner with a very well-trained strong voice
with about as much sweetness to it as cut glass.
The accompaniment she was rendering on the
piano was brilliantly executed, so much so that I
thought for a moment she had in a pianola record.
I peeped in the parlor and smiled at her, fearing
somehow that she must feel herself to be an outsider
and that was why she was not entering into
the fun of helping. I got no answering smile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
but something of a cold stare, so I beat a hasty
retreat and hastened off to consult with Miss
Maria about future meals.</p>

<p>I found that lady sitting on a bench in the
covered passage leading to the kitchen. Her
spirit was willing but her flesh was too much for
her. She must rest. I sank by her, not sorry
at all to indulge in a little sly resting of my own.
Cooking is great fun but certainly exhausting.</p>

<p>"What for dinner, Miss Maria?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, I can't contemplate your helping
about dinner, too!"</p>

<p>I couldn't help having a little inward fun with
myself over her speaking of my helping. I had
certainly cooked breakfast myself, but since she
fooled herself into thinking that I had only
helped to cook it, it made no difference to me.</p>

<p>"But someone will have to cook it unless the
servants are miraculously cured in time for it."</p>

<p>"That's so!" and she sighed a great sigh.</p>

<p>"I know you wish we would all of us go home,
but please don't wish it. We are having such a
good time and don't want to leave one little bit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! Don't think I could have
such inhospitable sentiments. My brother would
be deeply distressed if he thought you thought I
thought such things."</p>

<p>Both of us laughed at her complicated thinks
and then began the serious matter of dinner.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness, I had those trifling creatures
dress the chickens yesterday. That, at
least, is out of the way."</p>

<p>"Oh, good! Have you got them all dressed?
Then let's have chicken gumbo. If we make
enough of it, it will be the dinner, with a great
dish of rice to help in each soup plate."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" declared Dee, pausing for a moment
to listen to the proposed menu. "And it
will be such an economy in dishes, too. Just a
plate and spoon all around and no frills."</p>

<p>Dee had been as busy as possible washing
dishes while Miss Maria wiped, and I cleared the
table.</p>

<p>"But, child, can you make a gumbo? It is
very difficult, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. I have Mammy Susan's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
recipe tucked away somewhere in my brain. I
can get to work on it immediately and then it will
be done for dinner. It can't cook too long."</p>

<p>Dee and Wink undertook to gather the vegetables,
but they took so long that a relief and
search party had to be sent to the garden after
them.</p>

<p>They were so busy discussing the different
kinds of bandages that they had forgotten their
mission. Wink had taken a leaf from Adam's-and-Eve's-needle-and-thread
and was demonstrating
on Dee's arm the reverse bandage. Her
other arm was already decorated with the figure
eight style made from a long green corn leaf.
How I wished Wink would treat me as sensibly
as he did Dee. They seemed to be having such
a good time as I, who was one of the search
party, discovered them in the tomato patch solemnly
debating the values of the various styles.
Now if Wink had ever agreed to discuss such
a thing as that with me he would have felt compelled
to say all kinds of silly things, and as for
bandaging my arm,&mdash;it would have been out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the question, as he would have felt it necessary to
ask to kiss my hand or some such stuff.</p>

<p>The right kind of gumbo must have tomatoes,
okra, potatoes, onions and corn in it, and anyone
who has served apprenticeship under Mammy
Susan will make the right kind of gumbo. Miss
Maria and I started in preparing those vegetables
at nine o'clock and it took us one solid
hour to finish, working as hard as we could go. I
was beginning to be very fond of the old lady.
She was so gentle and sweet. I asked her many
questions about Maxton and its history, and
since, like many gentlewomen of her age, she
lived in the past, she was most happy to recount
to me tales of the lovely old place and its aristocratic
founders.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we have a ghost," she laughed, when
I asked her to tell me if there were any such inhabitants.
"It is a lady ghost, too, and inhabits
your wing of the house, as is the way with all the
ladies of Maxton. It is the young sister of my
great grandfather,&mdash;that makes her my great,
great aunt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, please tell me about her!"</p>

<p>"Well, all right, if you promise not to get
scared. The darkies keep such tales going.
They firmly believe in ghosts, and when they tell
a ghost story they always say either they themselves
have seen the dread shape or they know
someone who has seen it. This ghost has not been
seen at Maxton in my generation, but Jasper
and Milly have heard the tale from their grandparents
and they see that it is duly handed down
to their grandchildren. The appearance of this
spectre is supposed to presage dire calamity."</p>

<p>"Do you know anyone who has seen it?" I
asked, testing the skillet to see if it was hot
enough to begin frying the chicken. Chicken
for gumbo must be fried before you start the
soup, if anything so rich and thick as gumbo
could be called soup.</p>

<p>"I knew an old man who thought he had seen
it. Well, to go on with my tale:&mdash;this young
great, great aunt of mine was engaged to be married
to a gentleman of high degree, much older
than herself. This of course was back in Colonial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
days. She had consented to the match in
obedience to her father's commands, but she evidently
did not relish it very much. The day
came for the wedding and she was dressed in her
white gown and veil. The company had assembled
from miles around. A boat load of
guests from Williamsburg had arrived and the
feasting and dancing had begun. Among them
was a young blade from over the seas who had
paid court to the fair Elizabeth,&mdash;that was her
name. It was whispered that she returned his
love and that was the real reason for her reluctance
to mating with the lord of high degree.</p>

<p>"After being clothed in the wedding gown,
Elizabeth had sent the women from her room on
a plea that she must be alone to pray. She
locked the door the moment they were gone and
rushed to the window which was open, it being
a warm moonlight night. Standing below the
window was the lover. He called up to her to
come down to him. The ivy was thick on the
wall, as it is now, and for an agile young girl I
fancy it was not such a very difficult climb. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
must have taken a brave soul though to make the
start. Many a time in my youth," and here Miss
Maria blushed as red as one of the tomatoes she
was peeling, "I have sat in that window, it is the
room you are occupying, and tried how it would
seem to climb down that wall. I have never done
more than poke my foot out about an inch,
though. Perhaps if the lover had been calling to
me, it might have given me courage. Elizabeth
got about half-way down when her long satin
dress and veil got caught on a nail or snag of
some sort, and no matter how she pulled she
could not get loose. Just think of it! There the
poor girl hung, with her lover frantically calling
to her and the precious moments flying. Already
they were knocking on the door of her
chamber and crying out for admission. His
steed was ready to fly with her if only she could
get the gown loose. Material in those days was
stouter than now. I'll wager anything that a
piece of white satin could not be found now that
would not tear, or any other material, for that
matter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Remembering Mary's gown of the night before,
I readily agreed with her.</p>

<p>"Before the miserable lover could mount to
her side to cut the dress loose, the plot was discovered
and the poor girl had the agony of seeing
her true love killed by the infuriated bridegroom
to be. She swooned and it is said she
never regained consciousness. Her poor little
heart must have snapped in two. And now it is
said that sometimes her white figure can be seen
hanging from the ivied wall. Once in my youth
the darkies thought they saw it as they were
coming home from church on a moonlight night,
but on investigation it turned out to be a towel
that had blown out of the window and hung, perhaps
on the identical nail that was the undoing
of poor Elizabeth. I remember well," and she
laughed like a girl again, "how scared they all of
them were. It was in slave days and they were
forced to come to work the next day, but nothing
but being slaves could have made them
come."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Maria, Miss Maria!" I cried,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
dropping the potato I was peeling, "I know
now what is the matter with your servants. They
are not ill but they have seen the ghost!"</p>

<p>And I told her about Mary's ambition and her
escapade of the night before. The old lady almost
rolled off her chair she laughed so. She
was not one bit shocked but vastly interested.</p>

<p>"To think of her doing it! No lover was calling
her, either."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. How about it,
Mary?" I called to my friend who had come
down to help pick up chips now that the chamber
work was accomplished.</p>

<p>When I told Mary about the family ghost
story and that she was no doubt responsible for
the non-appearance of the servants, she was overcome
with confusion. Miss Maria begged her to
treat the matter as a joke.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, I never would have known
all you dear girls as I now do if it had not happened.
You would have come and gone as nothing
but Harvie's guests, and now you are my
own true friends. I am glad the reason why is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
unearthed, though, because now we can at least
make those good-for-nothings come and wash the
dinner dishes." She drew Mary down beside her
on the bench.</p>

<p>"But, Mary, you didn't answer me," I teased.
"I asked you if a lover was calling you when you
climbed down the wall."</p>

<p>"Yes! He is calling me all the time!" cried
Mary, striking an attitude of one being called by
a lover. "His name is Douglas Fairbanks."</p>

<p>"Douglas Fairbanks? I don't know the family,"
said dear old puzzled Miss Maria. "Who
is Douglas Fairbanks?"</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Maria, he is a movie actor, the
very best ever!" explained Mary.</p>

<p>"Where did you get to know him, child?
Who introduced you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know him, never saw him except on
the screen!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I see, a hero of romantic fiction!"</p>

<p>"But he's not fiction&mdash;he's the realest flesh
and blood person you ever saw in your life."</p>

<p>Then Mary tried to tell our hostess of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
wonders of the movie where Douglas was the
star. The old lady endeavored to take it all in,
but not having been to the city since the perfecting
of the cineomatograph, it was up-hill work.
Of course she knew that movies existed, but she
could not grasp the joy of them, as she had nothing
to go upon but the memory of a magic
lantern.</p>

<p>"Don't you like the theatre?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I like it very much. To be sure
I have never seen but two performances, but I
got great enjoyment from them. You must remember,
my dears, that I am country bred and
have had little chance to see the city sights."</p>

<p>I never realized before how cut off from the
world persons are who depend on steamboats.
Here was this dear lady, born and bred one of
the finest ladies of the land, but being of a naturally
retiring disposition and always having been
occupied from her girlhood with keeping house
she had let the world pass her by.</p>

<p>"What were the two things you saw, Miss
Maria?" asked Mary gently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch and the
Old Homestead. I was quite shocked at the
latter, was really glad I was with a lady. I think
I would have sunk through the floor from mortification
had there been a gentleman with me."</p>

<p>"The Old Homestead shocking?" I asked
wonderingly. "Not the Old Homestead! It
must have been something else."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I remember the title distinctly. It
was when they had that scene with that naked
statue in the parlor. It was terrible to me."</p>

<p>What a compliment to have paid the author
and actor of that time-honored play! Actually
the statue of the Venus de Milo had shocked this
simple soul from the country just exactly as
Denman Thompson had made it do the old man
in the melodrama. Mary and I didn't laugh, but
we almost burst from not doing so.</p>

<p>"And now I must send Harvie down to the
quarters to make those good-for-nothings return.
Sick, indeed! I intend to make every last one of
them take a dose of castor oil and turpentine!"</p>

<p>And the intrepid lady was as good as her word.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CIRCUS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gumbo being made and nothing to do but
cook it, and that quite slowly, I was able to run
from my self-imposed duties for a while and join
the crowd that had formed to go to the negro
quarters and persuade them that they were not
sick, that there was no ghost, and that their duty
and interests lay at Maxton.</p>

<p>The cabins were at least a quarter of a mile
from the great house, and very comfortable and
picturesque they were. The road lay through a
beautiful oak forest and then skirted a corn field.
Each cabin had a good piece of ground around it
and from every chimney there arose a curl of blue
smoke. They were evidently expecting a visit
from the family, because there were several little
pickaninnies waiting at a turn in the road, and
when they saw us they set off in a great hurry
shouting:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dey's a-comin'! Dey's a-comin'!"</p>

<p>"That's to give them time to get into bed before
we get there," said Harvie sagely. "I wish
I knew Latin and Greek as well as I do the
coloreds' methods."</p>

<p>Sure enough, we could see the little nigs running
from house to house shouting the warning.</p>

<p>"I reckon we would all learn Latin and Greek
if it was as simple as our friends' machinations,"
I said. "I bet you this minute Aunt Milly is
stirring up a cake or something for big meetin'
and she will have to hurry up and get it out of
sight."</p>

<p>It so happened Aunt Milly's house was the
first one we entered. Harvie knocked on the
door gently and then more briskly when there
was no answer. Finally a smothered sound
penetrated the closed door and windows.
"Ummmm! Ummmm!" Taking it to mean
we must enter, we opened the door. I sniffed
pound cake.</p>

<p>Aunt Milly's cabin boasted but one room and
an attic and a lean-to kitchen. The old woman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
whose bulk was only equalled by Miss Maria's,
was lying in bed. Her coal black face had no
look of illness but one of extreme determination.
She was showing the whites of her eyes like a
stubborn horse.</p>

<p>"How you do, Mr. Harbie?" she said thickly.
"An' all de yuthers ob you? Won't you take
some cheers and set a while?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Aunt Milly, we only came to
see how you were getting on and to tell you that
Aunt Maria hopes you will be up in time to wash
the dinner dishes."</p>

<p>"Me? No, Mr. Harbie! I'm feared I is seen
my last days er serbice."</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Milly, are you so ill as all
that?"</p>

<p>"Yessir! Yessir! I got a mizry in my back
an' my haid is fittin' tow bus'. I ain't been able
to tas'e a mouthful er victuals sence I don' know
whin. My lim's is all of a trimble and looks lak
my blood is friz in my gizzard."</p>

<p>"Have you had the doctor?"</p>

<p>"No, not to say recent! I was that sorry tow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
lay up whin yo' comp'ny was a-visitin' of yo'
grandpaw, but whin mawnin' come I jes' warn't
fitten tow precede."</p>

<p>"It is strange that all of you should have got
sick the same day, Aunt Milly," said Harvie, his
eyes twinkling with his knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p>"You don't say that that there Jasper an'
them gals didn't go do they wuck?" asked the
old woman, but her tone was somewhat half-hearted.
She was evidently not an adept at dissembling.</p>

<p>"Now, Aunt Milly, you know that not a
single servant turned up at the great house this
morning, and these young ladies had to do all the
cooking and housework, and we boys did the outside
work. You need not try to make me think
you didn't know it. We know exactly what is
the matter with all of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Laws-a-mussy, Mr. Harbie! Th' ain't
nuthin' 'tall the matter with me, but I's plum
wo' out. I been a-cookin' nigh onter mos' a hunnerd
years."</p>

<p>"But all these other servants haven't been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
cooking or anything else anywhere near that
long. We all of us know what is the matter: last
night coming home from big meeting there
wasn't a thing the matter. You all of you meant
to come back to work this morning. You came
home late, but you had promised Aunt Maria to
stay on while my guests were here, and you
meant to do it. The moon was shining bright
and just as you came over the hill and got out of
that bit of pine woods, off there towards the
landing, you saw a ghost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gawd in heaben, Mr. Harbie! Did you see
her, too?" Poor old Aunt Milly's eyes were almost
popping out of her head.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see her; I wish I had," and
Harvie gave Mary a nudge. "But Miss Page
Allison here saw it, and Miss Mary Flannagan
knows all about it because she was the ghost."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she&mdash;she was which?"</p>

<p>"It was this way, Aunt Milly," said Mary,
going over close to the old woman's bed. "I
wanted to see if I could climb down the ivy on
the wall outside of our window, and just as all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of you came home from church my&mdash;my&mdash;garment
got hung on a nail and I couldn't budge
for a moment. I snagged my thumb, too, see!"</p>

<p>"Well, if that don't beat all!" was all the old
woman had strength to say. She threw back the
bedclothes and disclosed her ample person fully
clothed in a purple calico dress. "Hyar, gimme
room tow git out'n this hyar baid. I's got a
poun' cake a-cookin' in de oben an' I s'picion it
nigh 'bout time ter take it out." She rolled out
of bed and waddled to the stove. "I's moughty
skeered the fire done gonter git low while Mr.
Harbie was a-argufyin'. It would 'a' made a sad
streak in my cake, an' that there is somethin' I
ain't never been guilty ob yit."</p>

<p>"Now, Aunt Milly," said Harvie, when our
minds were set at rest as to the perfection of the
cake which was done to a beautiful golden brown,
"you send for the rest of the servants and tell
them the truth about the ghost and let them know
they must be up at the great house within an
hour."</p>

<p>"Sho'! Sho', child!" she assured him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Grabbing a broom from the corner she jabbed
it under the bed, thereby causing much squealing.
Three little darkies rolled out, looking very
much like moulting chickens from the combination
of dust and feathers they had picked up
from their hiding place.</p>

<p>"Here you lim's er Satan! Run an' fotch all
de niggers on de plantation and tell 'em I say
come a-runnin' tow my cabin as fas' as they laigs
kin a carry 'em. You kin tell 'em I'se in a fit
an' that'll fetch 'em." She chuckled and sank on
a chair to have her laugh out.</p>

<p>The three emissaries made all haste with the
joyful news and in an incredibly short time the
cabin was full to overflowing. We went out in
Aunt Milly's little yard and Harvie mounted
an old beehive so he could make a speech. Aunt
Milly drove her black guests out, and they, feeling
they had been cheated of their natural rights
since she wasn't having a fit, stood sullenly at attention
while the young master told them the
truth about the ghost and gave them the ultimatum
about returning to Maxton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>They were not so easy to convince as Aunt
Milly. Mary's thumb might have been snagged
in some other way. Had they not seen the ghost
with their own eyes, the ghost they had been
hearing of ever since they were children? When
news came of Aunt Milly's being in a fit they
were sure that the prophetic calamity was upon
them presaged by the appearance of the ghost.
Mr. Harvie could talk all he wanted to, but they
were from Missouri. They had seen and were
convinced by what they saw. They were respectful
but firm in their attitude of unbelief. Jasper
spoke:</p>

<p>"I ain't a-gibin' you de lie, Mr. Harbie, but
I've done seed de ghoses an' you ain't. I's plum
skeered ter go up ter de gret house. My gran'mammy
done tell me yars an' yars gone by dat
whin dat ghoses comes fer me to clar out. She
say she after some nigger, my gran'mammy did.
De tale runs dat it war a nigger what tole de
bridegroom dat her beau lover was a-fixin' ter
tote her off, an' whin dat ere ghoses comes she
ain't come fer no good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would make you believe that it was
not a ghost, Uncle Jasper?" asked Mary, who
seemed to feel it was up to her to prove the falsity
of the ghost story.</p>

<p>"Nothin' but seein' it warn't. I b'lieve it war
a ghoses 'cause I seen it war a ghoses, an' whin I
see it ain't a ghoses I gonter b'lieve it warn't, an'
not befo'."</p>

<p>Mary drew Tweedles and me off in whispered
conference and then mounted the beehive by the
side of Harvie and made her maiden stump
speech. The darkies clapped with delight.
They had never seen a female prepare to make a
speech except under the stress and excitement
of getting religion.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"Do she mean us?" came in a hoarse whisper
from Willie, the yard boy, who was trying to get
religion but who experienced great difficulties
because of certain regulations in the way of not
eating and not laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean you," cried the orator. "Since
I am the person who was climbing out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
window last night when you were coming from
church, and since you will not believe it was not
a ghost unless you see me do it, I will take the
liberty to invite all of you up to the big house to
see the show. It will be a free show, a circus in
fact, and there may be a few other attractions,
too. Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Sho' we'll come!" came in a chorus.</p>

<p>"How 'bout big meetin'?" asked one of the
housemaids doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! This kin' er circus ain't no harm,"
declared one of the field hands. "Didn't de
young miss say it war a free circus?"</p>

<p>"Sho' it's free an' ain't we free, an' who gonter
gainsay us?" and the other housemaid tossed
her bushy head saucily.</p>

<p>"Yes, an' free and free make six an' six days
shall we labor an' do all the wuck, also the play,
fur the sebenth is the sabbath of the Lawd my
Gawd!" cried a voice from behind the cabin, and
then there came into view the strangest figure I
have ever beheld. It was a tall gaunt old colored
man with a straggly grey beard. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
dressed in wide corduroy trousers and top boots;
instead of a coat he wore a green cloth basque
with a coarse lace fichu and tied around his waist
was a long gingham apron. His hat was a wide
brimmed black straw trimmed in purple ribbons
with a red, red rose hanging coyly down over one
ear. He was smoking a corn-cob pipe. In his
hand he carried a covered basket.</p>

<p>"Lady John!" exclaimed Harvie. "I am
very glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Well, now ain't you growed!" said the crazy
old man in a voice as soft and feminine as one
could hear in the whole south; but at that moment
one of the little pickaninnies tried to peep
in his basket, and with a masculine roar, he laid
about him vigorously with his stick, and with a
deep bass voice gave the little fellow a tongue
lashing that drove him back into Aunt Milly's
cabin.</p>

<p>It seems that the old man had lost his reason
many years before and was now obsessed with
the desire to be considered a woman. He lived
alone in a cabin some miles from Price's Landing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
growing a little tobacco, enough corn for his
own meal, a little garden truck and a few fruit
trees. He had some chickens and when he could
save enough eggs he would bring them over for
Miss Maria Price to buy. The news of the ghost
seen at Maxton had traveled to his cabin in that
wonderful way that news in the country does
travel, and he had come over to add his quota of
superstition to the general store.</p>

<p>Harvie introduced the old man to the members
of the house-party. He caught hold of his apron
as though it had been a silken gown and made a
curtsey to each one.</p>

<p>"Lady John, we are just asking all of these
friends of ours to come up to the great house to
a kind of circus. They won't believe that it was
not a ghost they saw last night clinging to the
ivy on the east wall and we are going to prove
it to them. We shall be very glad to see you, too,
if you want to come."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, young marster, thank
you kindly! I was on my way up there whin the
crowd concoursing here distracted my intention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
I'll be pleased to come, pleased indeed." He
spoke in a peculiarly mincing way in a high voice.</p>

<p>"I thought you was too pious like to go to
the circus, Lady John," giggled the frivolous
housemaid.</p>

<p>"Well, you thought like young niggers think&mdash;buckeyes
is biscuit!" he declared in his natural
bass. "The Bible 'stinctly states that there was
circuses in them days, an' I ain't never heard er
no calamities a-befallin' them what was minded
to intend 'em."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" asked Dee. "I can't remember
where it said so, but then I do not know the Bible
as I should."</p>

<p>"Child! Look in the hunnerd chapter er
Zekelums an' there you'll fin' at the forty-'leventh
verse that Gawd said to Noah: 'Go ye to the
circus tents of the Fillystimes an' get all the wile
animiles that there ye fin' an' have a p'rade 'til
ye gits to the ark of the government.' Now if'n
the Lord Gawd warn't a-tellin' Noah to git them
animiles together for a show, what was it for?
What was it for, I say?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no answer to this pointed remark,
so he continued:</p>

<p>"An' Brother Dan-i-el! Brother Dan-i-el, I
say! What was he a-doin' in a cage of man-eatin'
lions for if he warn't in a circus? Answer me
that! And Brother 'Lige! Who ever hearn tell
of a gold chariot out of a circus p'rade? A chariot
of fire! I tell you they was monstous shows
in them days. If them Bible charack'-ters
warn't too good to ack in a circus, I reckon this
po' ole nigger ain't a-goin' to set up himanher
self as bein' above lookin' on."</p>

<p>"Maybe you will act in our circus then," suggested
one of the boys.</p>

<p>"No, sir! No, sir! I an' Brother 'Lish will
be contentment jes' to look on. Brother 'Lish,
he didn't make no move to jine the p'rade whin
Brother 'Lige wint by in his gran' chariot. He
was glad to stan' aside and let Brother 'Lige git
all the glory. He caught the velvet cloak with all
the gran' 'broidry and was glad to get it. I bet
nobody shouted louder than him whin Brother
'Lige stood up 'thout no cloak in his pink tights.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
I b'lieve that Brother 'Lish was glad to get that
cloak an' it come in mighty handy, 'cause they
do say that whin he was a-sittin' in Brother
'Lige's cabin that very night, the mantel fell on
him. No, sir, it never hurt him at all, but I
reckon they couldn't have much fire 'til they got
it put back. But he had the cloak to wrop up in."</p>

<p>This delightfully original interpretation of the
scriptures fascinated all of us. I could see Mary
was listening very attentively to Lady John.
He would be another stunt for the clever girl.
Mary was a great impersonator and could mimic
anything or anybody.</p>

<p>"Are you going to have the circus after dinner
or before?" asked one of the party.</p>

<p>"Before!" cried Mary. "I'd be afraid to
trust the ivy with my weight plus the gumbo I
intend to eat."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PERFORMANCE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we got back to Maxton, whom should
we find sitting on the bench by Miss Maria but
Mr. Jeffry Tucker? He looked as though he had
known her all her life and no one would have
dreamed that this was his second meeting with
her. His first had been the summer before when
that enterprising gentleman had made a trip to
Price's Landing to persuade Mr. Pore to wake
up to the fact that Annie was invited to go to
Willoughby on a beach party and that all he had
to do was let her go.</p>

<p>"Zebedee, darling! Where did you come
from?" cried Dee, breaking away from the
crowd as she spied her youthful father and racing
like a wild Indian to get the first hug.</p>

<p>"Richmond via Henry Ford!" he managed
to get out as Dum scrouged in for her share of
hugging.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"And, Page! Little friend!" he said, freeing
one of his hands and clasping mine.</p>

<p>How I did love to be called his little friend!
He never called me that in a way that made me
feel young and silly, either, but somehow he gave
me the impression that he was depending on me,
I don't know just for what but for something.
I was as glad to see him as his own Tweedles
were, I am sure.</p>

<p>"Did you come down alone?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I had the pleasure of the learned
discourse of Mr. Arthur Ponsonby Pore on my
journey hither."</p>

<p>"Oh, good! He is back, then, and maybe we
can have Annie," said Dee.</p>

<p>"She is upstairs now," announced that wonderful
man.</p>

<p>"Oh, Zebedee! I just knew you could work
it!" and Dee gave him another bear hug for luck.</p>

<p>Dee had sent a telegram to her father asking
him to get hold of Mr. Pore and persuade him
to hurry back and release Annie.</p>

<p>Miss Maria was anxious to hear of our success<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
with the servants and was delighted to know of
their contemplated return. When we told her
that the only way to get them back was to have
a circus, she was greatly amused. Zebedee, of
course, entered into the scheme with his usual
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"When is it to be?"</p>

<p>"Now!" I answered. "The darkies are on
their way, ten thousand strong."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, there are only five house servants,"
said Miss Maria.</p>

<p>"Yes, but all the field hands had laid off, too,
because of the ghost. I fancy all of the colored
people from the quarters are coming up to be
convinced against their will that the ghost was
not a ghost."</p>

<p>"But suppose Mary can't climb down again.
She might kill herself this time," wailed the poor
hostess.</p>

<p>"Not at all!" I reassured her. "It will be
much easier to do it in daylight than in darkness."</p>

<p>"Of course it will!" declared the intrepid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
movie star. "And, besides, last night was only
the dress rehearsal, and all actors say that the
dress rehearsal is much more nervous work than
the real performance. Now I must go dress my
part," and so we raced up to our room where we
found dear Annie unpacking her suitcase with
such a happy smile on her face that she looked
like an angel.</p>

<p>How we did chatter! We had to tell her all
about our plan for the society circus. Looking
out of the window where Mary was to make her
fearsome descent, Annie shuddered.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can do it."</p>

<p>"If <i>you</i> only could, what a bride you would
make!" exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>Mary had determined to dress as a bride and
now began the work of finding suitable duds.
Miss Maria came in to assist just when we were
beginning to despair. None of us was blessed
with enough clothes to be willing to spare any of
them for such a hazardous undertaking, none
save Jessie Wilcox and she had them to spare,
but we would not have asked her for any to save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
her. That superior young lady had been quite
scornful of us while we were working and then
afterwards on the walk to the quarters. Now
she had gone off for a row on the river with
Wink, who seemed to think that when I was so
enthusiastic over the arrival of the father of my
best friends he had a personal grievance. He
liked Zebedee a great deal himself but seemed to
think I did not have the same right. I am sure
Jessie was a brave girl to go rowing with a man
who had such a one-sided way of looking at
things. Anyone with such a biased judgment
could not be trusted to trim a boat, I
felt.</p>

<p>When Miss Maria found out our trouble, she
had Harvie bring from the attic a little old haircloth
trunk, and throwing it open, told us to help
ourselves. It was filled with all kinds of old-fashioned
gowns, some of them of rich brocade
and some of flowered chintz. At the very bottom
we unearthed a wedding dress which had belonged
to some dead and gone Price, Miss Maria
did not even know to whom. It was yellow with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
age but had not a break in it. It was some
squeeze to get the bunchy Mary in it, but with
much pulling in and holding of the breath we
finally got it hooked.</p>

<p>"And here's a veil!" cried Dum, who had been
standing on her head in the trunk hunting for
treasures.</p>

<p>It was nothing but a piece of white mosquito
netting that had been put in this trunk by mistake
evidently, but it was quite a find to us, and
with a few dexterous twists we had Mary standing
before us a blushing bride.</p>

<p>"How about your shoes, Mary?" I asked.
"Last night you said you had to have bare toes
to dig in the wall."</p>

<p>"So I have! Gee, what are we to do about it?
It would never do to have a barefoot bride; but I
simply could not climb down in shoes."</p>

<p>"I have it!" cried Dum. "Let's have a cavalier
down on the ground, your 'beau lover,' you
know, like the Elizabeth of long ago, and you
take off your slippers and throw them down to
him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good! Page, please go tell Shorty I need
him."</p>

<p>Shorty was game and in a twinkling of an eye
we had him rigged out as a very presentable if
rather youthful "beau lover."</p>

<p>The darkies had come and were seated on the
ground about twenty feet from the house. News
of a free show had spread like wildfire and I am
sure at least fifteen were gathered there. It
seemed hard that we must amuse fifteen to get
five.</p>

<p>The show opened with a boxing match between
the young men from Kentucky, Jack Bennett
and Billy Somers. This was most exciting and
nothing but the presence of General Price kept
the darkies from putting up bets on the fight.</p>

<p>Next on the program was the Tuckers' stunt:
Dum and Dee, back to back, were buttoned up
in two sweaters which they put on hind part before
and then fastened on the side, Dum's to
Dee's and Dee's to Dum's.</p>

<p>"This, Ladies and Gentlemen," said Zebedee,
who was doing the part of showmaster, "is Milly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Christine, the two-headed woman. She is the
most remarkable freak of nature in the world to-day.
She has two heads, four legs, four arms,
but only one body. She is very well educated
and can speak several languages at the same
time. She also can sing a duet with herself (at
least she thinks she can). Fortunately she is in
love with herself, otherwise she would get very
bored with herself. There is only one difficulty
about being this kind of a twin: if you don't like
what your twin likes you have to lump it. Now
Milly, here, sometimes eats onions and poor
Christine has to go around with the odor on her
breath; and Christine got her feet wet and poor
Milly has caught a bad cold from it." With this
Dee sneezed violently, a regular Tucker sneeze
which was as good as a show any time. "Milly
is always getting sleepy and wanting to go to
bed when Christine feels like dancing." Dee put
her head on her breast and gave forth stertorous
snores while Dum gaily waltzed around dragging
the sleeping twin. There were roars of applause.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Next Harvie came around the house walking
on his hands and Jim Hart doing cartwheels.
Rags had the stunt known as "Come on, Eph!"
It is a strange thing, where the performer
wiggles and shakes himself until his clothes seem
to be slipping off. All the time he emits sounds
from which one gathers that he wants Eph to
come on. This brought down the house and
Rags had an encore.</p>

<p>I had to dance "going to church" while the
twins patted for me. I never did have any little
parlor tricks but they would not let me off. The
darkies treated it quite seriously and when I
went around shaking hands, which is part of the
dance, they arose and joined the dance. This
broke the ice and warmed them up for the ghost
scene soon to follow.</p>

<p>The circus was proving a great success. The
rows of happy black faces gave evidence of that.
We had decided to have some music next, but
made the great mistake of putting Annie on the
program ahead of Jessie. It was taken as an
insult and that spoiled piece refused to sing at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
all. Annie sang charmingly, however. She accompanied
herself on a banjo, and if my dance
had started the darkies, her song got them all
going. She sang, "Clar de Kitchen." I wonder
if my readers know that old song. It was famous
once on every plantation but in this day of rag
time and imitation darky songs one hardly ever
hears it.</p>

<p>Of course before Annie got through, everybody
was joining in the chorus, and the darkies
were patting and some of them dancing. There
wasn't the ghost of a ghost in their minds now
and really we might have dispensed with the
grand finale as far as they were concerned.
Maxton was no longer a place to be shunned; but
Mary was to go through with her act before
lunch and I for one knew that that gumbo was
stewing down mighty thick. I stole off once and
stirred it and put it back a little.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GHOST OF A GHOST</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last patter occasioned by Annie's spirited
tune had died away and a sudden hush fell upon
the seated throng. It was time for the great act.
We thought the impressiveness of the scene
would be heightened if someone would tell the
story. General Price suggested Lady John as
the best raconteur of the neighborhood. Of
course Lady John was more than pleased to
comply. He loved to be in the lime light and to
show off. This was his opportunity.</p>

<p>"Ladies, gemmen an' niggers, what ain't
neither, some er you," he declaimed, standing up
on an ivy-covered stump and making his inimitable
curtsey, "I is a-makin' this speechifying at
the inquest of the white folks an' if respec' is not
handed to me it is also infused to them." That
rather silenced the tittering that Lady John's
elevation had caused.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gen'l Price is inquested me to lay befo' de
meetin' de gospel of de ghoses what is thought
by some to hant these here abode of plenty.
Without more pilaverin' I'll lay holt the shank
of the tale.&mdash;Mos' about a thousan' years ago
whin my gran'mammy warn't mo'n a baby an'
Gen'l Price here, savin' his presence, warn't even
so much as thought about although his amcestroms
were abidin' here, the tale runs they war
a young miss of the family by name Lizzy Betty.
Miss Lizzy Betty war that sweet an' that putty
that all the young gemmen war mos' ready to
eat her up. Ev'y steamboat that come a-sailin'
up de ribber brought beaux for Miss Lizzy
Betty. One young man come all dressed in gold
an' wid a long feather in his hat an' a sword as
long as a hoe han'le. He had no land an' he had
no boat but he come on his hoss a-ridin' ober de
hills, an' Miss Lizzy Betty she done tol' him she
would be his'n through sickness an' through
healthfulness.&mdash;But, ladies an' gemmen an' you
niggers what is 'havin' better'n I ever seed you
'have befo', ol' Marse Price he got yuther notions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in his haid. He see no reason why Miss
Lizzy Betty shouldn't marry to suit him stid er
herse'f. They was a rich ol' man what didn't
carry all his b'longin's on his back, an' ol' Marse
Price he go to de sto' an' come back with a dress
an' veil for Miss Lizzy Betty an' he say fer her
to go put it on an' he'd fotch the preacher. An'
'twas all the po' young thing could do to git
word to her beau lover. All the comp'ny was
dissembled an' de bride had comb out her har an'
put on de dress an' veil, whin she say to her
frien's an' de nigger maid fer them to lef her
alone fer a moment so she could wrastle in
prayer. So so soon as they got out her room, she
locked de do' an' thin she peeped out'n de winder,
an' thar, kind an' true, was de beau
lover."</p>

<p>At this point Mary poked her head out of the
window and Shorty appeared below brave in all
his finery, although it was not of pure gold as in
Lady John's version. This was some astonishment
to the old tale teller and he stopped in his
narrative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hist!" called the bride to Shorty below.
"Are you there, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" answered the future bluejacket.
"Can you climb down the wall or shall I come
up to you and carry you off in my flying machine?"</p>

<p>"I am coming down!" choked Mary. "But,
Algernon, I cannot scale the fearsome wall in
shoes and hose; what must I do?"</p>

<p>"Take them off, fair Lizzy Betty, and throw
them down to me."</p>

<p>With that, Mary threw down to the faithful
Shorty some huge tennis shoes, the property of
Harvie. Shorty caught them, one at a time,
and each catch felled him to the earth, much to
the delight of the audience.</p>

<p>Then began the dangerous act. The agile
Lizzy Betty was out of the window in a twinkling
of an eye. Her mosquito net veil floated in
the breezes. Her satin train she managed with
great dexterity, kicking it from her, thereby disclosing
to view the blue serge gym bloomers she
was wearing. She swung herself down until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
midway she came upon the fated snag; there she
paused and deliberately hooked her veil in the
nail.</p>

<p>Here old Lady John, seeing his chance, took
up the tale and began:</p>

<p>"As Miss Lizzy Betty was a-hurryin' down,
an' she sho' could clam like a cat, she got her
finery cotched on a rusty nail, an' thar she hung
as helpless as a ol' coon skin tacked on de barn
do'. De beau lover he dance up an' down like he
goin' crazy."</p>

<p>Shorty began to prance and cry out to his lady
love; but she hung there weeping in loud boo
hoos.</p>

<p>"Bymby ol' Marse Price 'gun ter 'spicion
sompen, an' he up'n bang on de chamber do'.
'Hyar there, Lizzy Betty! Come on an' git
married! The victuals is a-gittin' col' whilst you
is a-prayin'.' Po' Miss Lizzy Betty could a-hear
'em hollerin' and beatin' an' bangin', an' still her
dress it cotch on de nail. Jes' then de rich ol'
bridegroom come a-shamblin' roun' de house, an'
he an' de beau lover clasp one anudder in mortal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
death grips. De ol' man, he got so clost to him
dat de sword what was as long as a hoe han'le
didn' do de beau lover no good whatsomever, but
de lil' penknife what de ol' man carry for to
whittle with went clean home to de beau lover's
heart."</p>

<p>At the proper cue, Wink, who had submitted
to be dressed up in a red table cover with a Santa
Klaus beard made out of a switch borrowed from
Miss Maria, came sidling around the house.</p>

<p>"Vilyun!" he cried, and grabbing Shorty
around the waist, they wrestled and swayed until
Shorty's long silk stockings, borrowed from
Dum, came down and hung around his feet, and
his fancy trunks, nothing more nor less than a
bathing suit carefully rolled up, came unrolled
and hung down in a most ludicrous manner.
Finally the deadly penknife was dug into his ribs
and he expired, calling to the lovely Lizzy Betty.</p>

<p>"An' de lubly Miss Lizzy Betty, she tuk a fit
then an' thar an' if'n her paw hadn't er got a
ladder an' gone up'n unhooked her, she'd a-been
hangin' thar yit, same as in dis hyar circus," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Lady John pointed impressively at the bunchy
figure of Mary clinging to the ivy with fingers,
teeth and toe-nails.</p>

<p>The applause could have been heard down at
the landing, I am sure. Mary unfastened her
mosquito net veil from her head and finished her
descent, leaving the veil caught to the snag.</p>

<p>"Now, you black rascals," cried General
Price, "you can see the ghost any night you've a
mind. There she hangs, and I reckon I'll leave
her there to shame you with. Now get to work!"</p>

<p>His words were stem but his face wore a smile
and his tone was kindly. The field hands went
off to work, the uninvited guests melted away,
and the house servants took up their tasks where
we had left off.</p>

<p>Willie, the yard boy, wore a broad grin on his
countenance. I heard him say to one of the
housemaids:</p>

<p>"I done mist my chanst for de kingdom dis
year. I 'lowed I'd come through to-night, but
these hyar carryin's on done flimflammed me. I
been a-laughin' an' singin' an' what's more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a-dancin', an' 'twarn't no David a-dancin' befo'
de Lord, nuther. 'Twas jes' a-pattin' an' Clar
de Kitchen dance. I hear rumors of gumbo for
dinner, too, an' I sho' is glad I done turned from
grace. I hope de young misses what concocted
of de gumbo done put my name in de pot. Dis
here seekin' is pow'ful appetizin'."</p>

<p>Our circus had been a decided success. Old
and young, black and white had enjoyed it.
Mary felt that she had redeemed herself. Had
she not scared the servants off and then wiled
them back? Had she not held thousands thrilled
and breathless while she made her perilous descent?</p>

<p>"It is wonderful for you to be able to climb
that way," said our courtly host. "I have never
seen a young lady so agile."</p>

<p>"But I shall have to learn to climb in shoes,"
sighed our movie star. "Douglas Fairbanks
can."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PICNIC</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a crowd of young people get together
there is sure to be a picnic if there is a spark of
life in them. There were many sparks of life in
this crowd, enough to supply many picnics.</p>

<p>We had been at Maxton ten days when the
picnic came off, and we had had ten days of unalloyed
fun. Of course, we had many gags on
each other and jokes that were only jokes because
we were on a house-party together. Those
jokes if told would sound very flat, indeed. I
believe there is no bore so great as the person
who has been off with a crowd for a fortnight and
comes back and tries to bring to life all the silly
jokes that were perpetrated. They may have
been brilliant and witty at the time, but it takes
the setting and the circumstance to make them
appear so to someone not blessed with an invitation
to said house-party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tucker had come and gone and come
again when we decided to go on the picnic. His
faithful Henry Ford could bring him to Price's
Landing in about one-fourth of the time it took
if one trusted to the deliberate meanderings of
the steamboat. He was a favorite with all of the
party, young and old, and his arrival was hailed
with delight. Miss Maria put on her best and
filmiest lace cap for his benefit, and to her delight,
that wonderful man noticed it and talked to
her about old lace with a knowledge that astounded
her.</p>

<p>He told me afterwards he found lace a
topic which always interested old ladies, so he
had deliberately made it his business to find out
about lace and be prepared to converse on the
subject. He also had some general knowledge
of crochet stitches, and knew how much yarn it
took to knit a sweater. It was too ludicrous to
see him solemnly talking fancy work with some
ancient dame. Tweedles and I have been sent
off into hysterics when we have found him bending
over a rainbow afghan, with some old lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
eagerly asking his advice as to the depth of the
border or something else equally feminine. He
seldom went home, after a week-end spent at
some resort, that he did not have a commission
to match embroidery silk for some lady who had
calculated wrong, or send back a bale of wool for
some energetic person who had suddenly decided
to knit socks for the poor Belgians or a sweater
for a long-suffering male relative. Certainly
Zebedee's interest and knowledge on the subject
of lace caps would have won Miss Maria's affections
had they not already been his.</p>

<p>General Price was as glad to see him as was
his old sister. Of course, the European war was
of paramount interest to everyone during those
years, and Jeffry Tucker always brought some
item of news to be recounted and discussed. He
came laden with newspapers and magazines, and
the general would bury himself under them, only
emerging for meals. He and Zebedee would
spend hours discussing the situation. Topographical
maps were studied until one would
think those two gentlemen could have found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
their way blindfolded over every inch of the western
front.</p>

<p>The Mexican situation, too, must be thoroughly
threshed out. The old warrior was like
some ancient war horse that sniffs the battle
from afar. As a veteran of the Civil War he had
many experiences to recount and analogies to
bring forth. Mr. Tucker listened to him with an
attention that was most flattering. Naturally
General Price freely announced that Tucker was
the most agreeable man of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Ponsonby Pore spent one evening
with us at Maxton and the general and Zebedee
hoped to get some new outlook from their English
acquaintance on the subject of the war that
so nearly touched him, since many of his kinsmen
must surely be in the trenches; but Mr. Pore's
interest seemed purely academic, and as his
knowledge was principally gained from two- and
three-week-old London <i>Graphics</i>, those voracious
gentlemen got but little satisfaction from
the hours spent with Arthur Ponsonby.</p>

<p>"He cares more about what language will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
finally be spoken on the Servian border than he
does about the submarine menace!" cried Zebedee
indignantly, coming out on the gallery where
I was getting a breath of air after a particularly
trying dance with poor Wink, who never had
learned how. We danced almost every night at
Maxton,&mdash;tread many a measure, as our dear old
host put it. Dee said she thought Wink was a
good dancer and she seemed to be able to keep
step with him very well, but the Gods evidently
had ordained that Wink and I could do nothing
in harmony. He either stepped on my toes or I
stepped on his,&mdash;the latter arrangement I much
preferred.</p>

<p>"Well, when you come right down to it," I
said, defending poor Mr. Pore, "that is, after
all, a very important thing. What language is to
be spoken there will mean which side is victorious."</p>

<p>"I know that, little Miss Smarty, but I also
know if I have to listen any longer to that Britisher's
rounded periods, what language will be
spoken here,&mdash;it will not be fit to print, either.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
How can a man sit still down on the banks of a
river in a foreign country and feel that it is not
up to him to do a single thing for his country
when her very existence is in peril!"</p>

<p>"But what can he do?"</p>

<p>"Do? Heavens, Page, he can do a million
things!"</p>

<p>"He is too old to fight."</p>

<p>"No one is ever too old to fight,&mdash;that is, to
put up some kind of a fight. He does not even
contribute to a relief fund! He as good as told
me he did not. He says he is afraid that what he
sent might fall into the hands of the Germans
and help them, so he considers it more patriotic
not to send anything. I've been taking up for
that man against Tweedles, but ugh! I'm
through now."</p>

<p>"Oh no, you are not," I laughed; "if Mr.
Pore should come out on the porch this minute
and ask a favor of you, I bet you would be just
as nice to him as you always have been."</p>

<p>"Never! Five pounds of Huyler's if I am
not as cold as a fish to His Nibs!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>At this psychological moment His Nibs appeared.</p>

<p>"Aw, I say, Mr. Tucker, when you return to
Richmond, will you be so kind as to do a little
commission for me?"</p>

<p>Zebedee made inarticulate noises in his throat
and Mr. Pore continued:</p>

<p>"Some freight has gone astray and if you
could look it up from that end, it would be of
great assistance to me."</p>

<p>"Have you written about it?" Zebedee's
manner was not quite so Zebedeeish as I could
have wished, since five pounds of Huyler's was
at stake.</p>

<p>"No, I have not corresponded with the wholesale
firm from whom I purchased the goods, as
I heard from my daughter that you were expected,
and I considered that it would be much
more satisfactory to all concerned if you could
give it your personal attention."</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Pore mentioned Annie, Zebedee
seemed to have a change of heart. He evidently
felt that Annie's father must be cajoled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
into good behavior, and nothing must be done or
said to make that stubborn parent have an excuse
for taking any pleasures from Annie.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Pore," he said politely, if a
little distantly. "Just give me your bill of
lading and I will look into the matter for
you."</p>

<p>In my mind's eye I saw the five pounds of
candy. I had certainly won. But was it fair of
me to take advantage of poor Zebedee's tender
heart? Certainly not!</p>

<p>"Shall it be chocolates?" he asked, when Mr.
Pore had finished his transaction and taken himself
off.</p>

<p>"It shall be nothing!" I exclaimed. "Don't
you know I know why you were decent to the
old fish? It was not just plain politeness that
made you do it, it was your feeling for Annie,
poor little thing!"</p>

<p>"How do you know so much?"</p>

<p>"Why, I saw you change your mind the moment
he dragged in Annie, and I knew what you
were thinking just as much as though you had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
said it aloud: 'Don't do anything to make things
hard for Annie.' Now isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"Page, you are uncanny! Can you read
everybody's mind?"</p>

<p>"Of course not! Only yours," I laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I am thinking now?"
He looked at me very intently. The light from
the hall was flooding the gallery and I could see
way down into his clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>"N-o!" I hesitated, and I am afraid blushed,
too. "But I wish you would think that it would
be nice to go try that new wiggly dance Jessie
Wilcox has just brought from New York."</p>

<p>"I see, if you can't read my mind all the time,
you can at least make me think what you want
me to. Come on, honey, and show me the dance."</p>

<p>I got the candy in spite of my protestations of
not deserving it.</p>

<p>The picnic was to be at Croxton's Ford, a
beautiful spot about three miles down the river.
The naphtha launch held eight quite comfortably
and the rest were to go in rowboats. Mary and
Shorty insisted upon paddling the canoe, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
they were warned that it would be a tiring
job, especially coming back.</p>

<p>Miss Maria had planned to go with us although
an all day picnic was a great undertaking
for one of her shape, but she was very particular
with girls intrusted to her and chaperoned most
religiously. On the very morning of the picnic,
sciatica seized her and she simply could not get
out of bed. The general had business at the
court-house and was off very early in the morning,
so his going was out of the question. Miss
Maria lay there groaning and moaning, miserable
that her conscience could not consent to our
going on such a jaunt, unchaperoned. As
Tweedles and I had never been overchaperoned,
in fact knew very little about such necessities, it
seemed absurd to us.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean we can't go without a
chaperone?" wailed Dum, who had set her heart
on a long row in a little red boat that appealed to
her especially.</p>

<p>"My dear, I am so sorry! I would get up if
I could."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I wouldn't have you get up, dear Miss
Maria. I just want you to lie still and get well.
We don't need a chaperone!"</p>

<p>"I know you don't need one, my child, but I
have never heard of a picnic at Croxton's Ford
without a chaperone."</p>

<p>"But Zebedee's a grand chaperone," put in
Dee. "He is that particular! Why, Dum and
Page and I have never been chaperoned in our
lives."</p>

<p>"Zebedee's the strictest thing!" maintained
Dum.</p>

<p>"So he may be," smiled the old lady, although
one could see that the twinges in her poor hip
were giving her great agony, "but as perfect as
he is, he is not a woman."</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;he is certainly not that."</p>

<p>"Jessie Wilcox has never been on a picnic in
her life without a chaperone, and I could not consent
to one from Maxton unless it was perfectly
regular."</p>

<p>A tap on the door disclosed the sympathetic
Zebedee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please let me come in," he begged.</p>

<p>After a hasty donning of boudoir cap and bed
sacque, he was admitted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tucker, I am so sorry, but I cannot let
the girls go on a picnic without a chaperone,"
said the old lady.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" and his eyes twinkled.
"I'm going, though, and I am a perfect ogre of
a chaperone, eh, Page?"</p>

<p>"Yes, something fierce, but Miss Maria says
you are not a woman."</p>

<p>"That's so!" he said, puckering up his brows.
We were mortally sure he was going to find a
way. He always did. "How about Aunt
Milly? She is perfectly respectable and would
guard the young ladies like gold, I am sure."</p>

<p>"We-ll, I remember before the war we often
went great distances with our maids. I think
she would do. Please send her to me."</p>

<p>Zebedee rushed to do her bidding, but he evidently
had an interview with Aunt Milly before
he sent her to Miss Maria, as that old darky
entered the bed chamber in a broad grin, tying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
something up in the corner of her bandanna
handkerchief as she came.</p>

<p>"Milly, I want you to chaperone for me to-day,"
said the poor invalid, groaning as she
tried to move a bit in her great mahogany
bed.</p>

<p>"Sho', Miss Maria! Does you want me to do
it wif goose grease? Or maybe you'd like dat
mixture er coal ile an' pneumonia? Dat's a great
mixture. 'Twill bun you up but it sho' do scatter
de pain."</p>

<p>"I don't mean massage, I said chaperone,"
and Miss Maria laughed in spite of her sciatic
nerve.</p>

<p>"Yassum! I 'lowed you meant rub, an' I's
mo'n willin' to rub. You'll hab to 'splain. I
ain't quite sho' in my min' what shopper-roonin'
is, but if it'll ease yo' pain, you kin jes' call on ol'
Milly."</p>

<p>"It would ease my pain greatly if you would
go with the young ladies on the picnic."</p>

<p>"Cook for 'em?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Aunt Milly," I interrupted, "we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
never let the chaperone cook,&mdash;just to look after
us and keep us straight."</p>

<p>"Lawsamussy, chile! You all don't need nobody
to keep you straight. Th' ain't nothin'
wrong wid you all but jes' you's a little coltish."</p>

<p>"I know they don't need anyone, Milly, but I
have never heard of a picnic at Croxton's Ford
without a chaperone, and I wouldn't be willing
for them to go without one."</p>

<p>"All right, Miss Maria! But you ain't
thinkin' 'bout sendin' me nowhar in one er them
thar skifty boats, is you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Aunt Milly!" said Dee reassuringly.
"You must have a comfortable seat in the stern
of the naphtha launch. We will give you the
place Miss Maria would have had could she have
gone."</p>

<p>"Well, Gawd save us! I ain't nebber set foot
on or in the ribber in all my life an' I been born
an' bred on its banks, too," and the old woman
drew forth a big red bandanna handkerchief and
wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>As she did so she came upon the something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
round and hard tied up in its corner, and at the
same time she glanced up at Mr. Tucker. He, in
a seemingly absent-minded way, put his hand in
his pocket and jingled his keys and coin.</p>

<p>"Well, all right, Miss Maria! If you say I
mus' go, I reckon 'tain't fer me to gainsay you.
Who gonter do my wuck at home?"</p>

<p>"There won't be much work to do, Milly, since
all of the young people are going away, and the
general has planned to spend the day at the
court-house. The lunch baskets are ready, are
they not?"</p>

<p>"Yassum! I been up sence sunup a-packin'
'em. It seemed like ol' times to be a-packin' all
them victuals. I 'member what a gret han' you
was for pickaniggers whin you was a gal. I
reckon it's a-cuttin' all them samwidges yistiddy
dat done combusticated yo' hip now. You better
let me rub you befo' I go a shopper-roonin'."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Milly, but if you chaperone, that
will be work enough for you for to-day. You
had better get ready now. Tell Willie to take
you to your cabin in the buggy and wait and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
drive you back. You must hurry and not keep
the young ladies waiting."</p>

<p>Aunt Milly waddled off, filled with importance
and pride but secretly dreading a water
trip. Dee insisted upon massaging the poor invalid,
who really was suffering intensely. Dee
was a born nurse and was never so happy as when
she could take command in a sick room. She
drove all of us out, insisting the patient must be
quiet. Wink, who was really and truly a doctor
now, was called in and readily prescribed and
what's more produced the medicine from a little
kit he carried about with him. Dee rubbed and
rubbed until it was time to start on the picnic.
Miss Maria was so soothed that she dozed off and
Dee tiptoed out of the room without making a
sound.</p>

<p>No doubt the poor old lady enjoyed her day
of quiet and rest. We must have been a great
trial to her, because we were a noisy, hoydenish
lot. Those of us who didn't sit up late at night
making a racket, got up early in the morning to
do so, and vice versa. She was so sweet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
good-natured about us that she never let us feel
we were a nuisance, but I am sure we must have
been.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SHOPPER-ROON</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course Aunt Milly kept us waiting. There
is no telling what rite she performed in her cabin
in preparation for the momentous occasion of
chaperoning. We were all seated in the boats
waiting, the lunch stowed carefully in the locker
of the launch and the bathing suits tucked under
the seats, when Willie came racing up in a light
red-wheeled buggy, one side so bent down with
Aunt Milly's great weight that the springs were
touching.</p>

<p>"Gawd pertec' me!" she prayed as Harvie
and Zebedee between them handed her into the
launch. The little craft did some perceptible
sinking with the extra load and had to be
lightened a bit.</p>

<p>"Sleepy, you had better get out," teased
Rags.</p>

<p>Poor Sleepy had been having a strenuous week<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
trying to monopolize Annie Pore. This was a
difficult thing to do, as Annie seemed to attract
the male sex willy nilly. She had no idea of
flirting and never meant to hurt anyone, but
there was something about her that appealed to
the masculine element irresistibly. Wherever
she went she made conquests by a certain clinging
vine attitude she had towards the whole
world. Mere man likes to be looked upon as a
protector and Annie's timidity was meat and
drink to his vanity. George Massie, alias
Sleepy, was her slave; Harvie Price thought he
looked upon her as a little sister, but I have never
yet seen a big brother quite so anxious for the
comfort of nothing but a sister; Jack Bennett
seemed to find her very attractive and divided his
allegiance between her and Dee; nothing but his
loyalty to Sleepy kept Ben Raglan from entering
the lists for the favor of the little English
maid. He occasionally teased poor Sleepy, but
that young giant never did know what I knew:
that Rags really cared for Annie.</p>

<p>Sleepy, knowing that the launch was the safest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
place in which to embark for a picnic and understanding
how timid Annie was and how poor a
swimmer, had ensconced her in that vessel in a
protected spot, and had found a place at her feet
where he could look up into her pretty face.</p>

<p>"Me get out? Get out yourself!" he cried indignantly.</p>

<p>"But it is not quality they want out but quantity,"
answered Rags. "You and Aunt Milly,
being in the same boat, can't ride in the same
boat."</p>

<p>Now George Massie was not really fat, but
because of his great bulk he was usually thought
of as being so. Certainly his bones were well
covered but his muscles were hard as iron. What
fat was there was well hammered down. He
must have weighed at that time at least two hundred
and twenty pounds, but then his six feet two
inches could carry a good many pounds. He
was cursed with money if ever a young man was.
His father was very wealthy and George had
never been denied a single thing in all his life.
His principal ambition had been to make the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
football team at the University and even that had
been granted him,&mdash;not because of money but
because of brawn.</p>

<p>He was studying medicine in a desultory way,
taking a year longer to finish his course than the
more ambitious Wink, who was not cursed at all
with money but had unbounded energy and ambition.
Sleepy's friends, and he had many of
those necessary things, all adored him. He was
so honest, so straightforward, so sympathetic.
They deplored his lack of ambition, however. I
used to feel that Sleepy was a lesson to all of the
young men in his set because they realized that
after all too much money often had a softening
effect on character. There seemed to be no especial
use for George Massie to graduate, because
after he got his diploma what difference
would it make whether he got patients or not?
His adoration of Annie Pore had had a good effect
on him, so Jim Hart had told me. The last
year at the University he had done better studying
than he ever had in his life, and his friends
had hopes of his waking up to the fact that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
world might need him, even if he did not need the
world's money in doctor's fees.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sleepy! You'll have to vamoose," insisted
Jack Bennett, trying to squeeze himself
down between George Massie and Annie.</p>

<p>"You are as big as any two other passengers,"
declared Rags.</p>

<p>"If that is the case, then suppose two other
passengers take to the life-boats," suggested
Zebedee. "Come on, Page, you are light and
easy to row and there is a nice little brown boat
waiting for us."</p>

<p>Dum and Billy Somers had already started in
their picturesque red skiff, and Mary Flannagan
and Shorty were well on their way in the canoe.
They had been independent and had not had to
wait while Aunt Milly arrayed herself in all the
glories of a brand new purple calico and bright
plaid head handkerchief.</p>

<p>"All right!" I acquiesced to Mr. Tucker's
proposal.</p>

<p>After we were transferred to the little brown
boat and on our way to Croxton's Ford, he said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid I was selfish to ask you to come
with me. I know I should not have taken you
away from all of your young friends."</p>

<p>"Why, Zebedee! How absurd! You are the
youngest friend I have, much the youngest."</p>

<p>"But you gave a very sad and unenthusiastic
'all right' to my proposition to come by skiff.
Now, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't that I didn't want to come with
you," I declared.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but merely that you didn't
want to leave someone else to come with me.
Now fess up, honey!"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to fess up about."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why did you look so crestfallen
when I put it up to you to leave the launch?"
and Zebedee dug his oars in the water with some
viciousness.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You what?"</p>

<p>"I had a reason for wanting to stay in the
launch."</p>

<p>"Didn't I say so? Who was the reason?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"It wasn't a who, at all&mdash;it was a which."</p>

<p>"A which?" he asked somewhat mystified.</p>

<p>"Yes, a which! If you must know, I wanted
to be under the awning because of my freckled
nose," and I blushed until it hurt. My nose was
a great annoyance to me. It was such a little
nose to get so many freckles on it. The fact that
they disappeared in the winter was but cold comfort
to me.</p>

<p>"But I like freckles," he said quite solemnly,
but his eyes were dancing with amusement.</p>

<p>"But I don't, and it's my nose. You are the
only person who does like 'em."</p>

<p>"Who has been telling you he doesn't like
them?"</p>

<p>"Nobody to my face, or rather to my freckles,
but I heard Jessie Wilcox talking to someone
about me and she called me a speckled beauty,&mdash;just
exactly as though I were a trout or a coach
dog or a turkey egg or something. And I know
after this day on the water I'll be a sight."</p>

<p>"Do you care what she says?"</p>

<p>"I care what anybody says."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, little friend, I did not dream you put
so much value on the opinion of others, especially
where mere personal appearance is concerned."
I thought I detected a note of disappointment in
his voice.</p>

<p>"I don't about everything, but one's nose is
mighty close to one, somehow."</p>

<p>"So it is," he laughed, "and I am so sorry to
have been the means of injuring that touchy
member. I can't help feeling kind of happy,
though, that it was the awning you were loath to
leave and not some one of those boys. Here's a
nice linen handkerchief; why don't you tie that
over your nose?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker always had the nicest linen handkerchiefs
I ever saw, and he seemed to have clean,
folded ones ready to produce for every emergency.
I accepted his offer and tied it over the
lower part of my face.</p>

<p>"Now you look like a little Turkish lady.
Please say you are glad you came in the little
brown boat," and my boatman shipped his oars
and drifted with the current.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very easy thing to say because I was
very glad. Now that my poor little nose was
protected, I was perfectly happy. I always enjoyed
being with Zebedee. We never talked out
and we seldom had a disagreement; not that we
agreed on every subject by any means, but we
could disagree without having a disagreement.
We talked about everything under the sun from
Shakespeare to the musical glasses. I couldn't
help comparing this boat ride to the one I had
been overpersuaded to take with Wink only a
few days before. We had started out with the
best of intentions on my part to avoid all shoals
in conversation, but before we had been out ten
minutes Wink was gnawing his little moustache
in fury and I was wishing I had stayed on shore.
A row with Wink was sure to end in a row (pronounced
rou).</p>

<p>The launch arrived at Croxton's Ford long before
we did, but we came as fast as the current
allowed, having drifted a good part of the way.
The party had landed and had begun to make the
camp for the day. It was a wonderful spot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
chosen for the picnic. A large creek, flowing
into the river, broadened out almost into a lake,
and in the mouth of this creek were innumerable
small islands. Some of them had large trees
growing on them, lovely sandy beaches and strips
of verdure; others were too young to have trees
but were covered with grass. The camp was
pitched on the largest island, right at the mouth
of the creek that afforded a landing for the
launch. There was a famous spring on this island
that was thought by the county people to
have some great curative power. What it cured
you of I don't know, but it tasted too good to be
much good as a medicine, I imagine.</p>

<p>Aunt Milly, who had proven herself to be an
ideal chaperone, having slept during the entire
journey, was now ensconced under a water oak
on a warm sand bank with nothing to do but enjoy
herself. This she did immediately by falling
asleep again.</p>

<p>"Whin I ain't a-wuckin', I's a-sleepin'," she
droned as slumber enfolded her.</p>

<p>Of course the camp fire must be made and potatoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and corn put to roast and the coffee-pot
filled with the sparkling spring water. The trip
down had made everybody hungry, whether accomplished
without exertion as by those in the
launch; or with the sweat of the brow as by Mary
and Shorty in the canoe, or Dum and Billy Somers
in the red skiff; or with just enough work to
keep the boat in the current which was Zebedee's
and my method of locomotion: one and all were
hungry.</p>

<p>"While dinner is cooking, let's have a swim,"
suggested Harvie. "You girls take this side of
the island for a dressing-room and we'll take the
other. Here are some low willows that make
splendid walls."</p>

<p>Bathing suits were produced and while our
chaperone slumbered and slept, we got into them
and then into the water. Such water! It was
clear and soft, so much more so than the water
of the big river. The bottom was clean sand
with no disturbing rocks and snags. The trees
shaded the place chosen for our swim where the
sloping beach made it safe for the timid close to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
shore, but ten yards of perseverance plunged the
bold swimmer into really deep water.</p>

<p>The shouts of joy would have waked the dead
had there been any on the island, but nothing
waked the sleeping Aunt Milly. She had burrowed
down in the unresisting sand almost as
deep as some meteoric stone might have done.
There she lay, having the rest that she deserved
after the "mos' a hun'erd years er cookin'" that
she declared she had served at Maxton.</p>

<p>"This is my island!" cried Dum, swimming
over to a beautiful spot about twenty yards from
camp. She clambered out on the strip of sand
and stood with arms outstretched looking very
handsome, her lithe young figure drawn up to
its full height. "I am monarch of all I survey!
I'm queen of this land!"</p>

<p>"Let me come help you rule," pleaded Billy
Somers, who had followed her.</p>

<p>"I don't need a prime minister just now,
thank you, but you might get in the waiting list."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully!" and the young Kentuckian
threw himself on the warm sand at her feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
What nice fellows those Kentuckians were, anyhow!
They were full of life and fun, clean
minded, clear thinking, well-mannered boys.
Dum and Billy were friends from the moment
they met and were usually the ringleaders in
any larks that were started on the house-party.
The strange thing about the friendship was that
they looked alike, so very much alike that I believe
some pioneer ancestor of Billy's must have
come from the Tucker stock.</p>

<p>Billy's hair had a bit more red in it than
Dum's, not much, just enough to make his hair in
the shade about the color Dum's was in the sun.
Their foreheads were identical and their chins
had the same tendency to get square when an
argument was under way. They really looked
quite as much alike as the twins themselves did.
Zebedee declared that Billy made him feel a
hundred years old because he looked so like his
son, if he had ever had one. Billy was about
three years older than the twins, and when we
consider that the twins were born when their
father was only twenty, no wonder the possibility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of a son at seventeen made poor Mr. Tucker
blue.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/house003.png" width="367" height="500" alt="&quot;THIS IS OUR ISLAND AND WE ARE GOING TO PERMIT NO ALIENS TO LAND HERE.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THIS IS OUR ISLAND AND WE ARE GOING TO PERMIT NO ALIENS TO LAND HERE.&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="#Page_178">Page 178</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>"This is our island and we are going to permit
no aliens to land here," called Dum as a challenge
to all of us. "I am Queen Dum and Billy
is General Billdad. We have held counsel and
herewith make the proclamation that there is to
be no immigration to this kingdom."</p>

<p>It took only a moment for us to answer the
challenge. Dee headed the opposing forces,
making a long dive that brought her up almost
on the beach of the little kingdom. Dum was
ready to push her back in the water and kerflop!
she went before Zebedee could come to her aid.
Then ensued such a battle as had not been
fought in the United States since Custer's last
rally.</p>

<p>Of course Dum and Billy had the advantage
of position, but we so far outnumbered them that
it took all of their strength to keep us from landing.</p>

<p>"Mary! Mary! You and Shorty come be our
allies!" called Queen Dum to the couple who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
had gone to housekeeping on a small island near
her own. Mary slid into the water like a turtle
and Shorty followed. They landed from the
rear and now the battle raged fiercely.</p>

<p>I know I got pitched back into the water at
least a dozen times. Having learned to swim
only the summer before at Willoughby, I was
not a past master in the art, but I could keep
above water indefinitely, thanks to Zebedee, my
instructor, who had made floating the first requisite.</p>

<p>The odds were in our favor but the vantage
they had in position was well-nigh discouraging
us, when Zebedee and Wink made a flank movement
and landed on the other side of the island,
immediately pushing over the opposing forces
into the foaming torrent and then pulling all of
us onto dry land.</p>

<p>"Victory! Victory!" we shouted; and then
for the first time since the battle began to rage
we remembered our chaperone. She had awakened
and dug herself out of her warm sand nest.
What were her charges up to? It never entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the old woman's head that we were playing a
game, and I fancy we looked in dead earnest.</p>

<p>When she had dozed off after landing we were
all of us clothed and in our right minds, and
suddenly she awoke to find us anything but
clothed, according to her strict ideas of propriety
among the quality, never having seen girls in
bathing suits; and not only were we in disgraceful
dishabille, but we were engaged in a distressing
brawl.</p>

<p>"My Gawd! My Gawd!" she wailed. "Here
I been a-slumberin' an' sleepin' an' Miss Maria
done tol' me to shopper-roon. I trus'ed de
white folks an' look at 'em!" She covered her
face with her hands and wept aloud.</p>

<p>I fancy we were something to look at. Bathing
caps were off and hair wet and tangled
streaming down our backs. Dee had lost a
stocking in the tussle and Rags had been bereft
of more than half of his shirt, so that his white
back gleamed forth in a most immodest abandon.
Shorty had tapped Harvie on the nose and that
scion of a noble race was bleeding like a stuck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
pig. The gore added color to the scene, and had
not Aunt Milly already been certain that this
was a real war we were raging, the blood of her
young master would have convinced her.</p>

<p>"Hi, you! You!" she called. "Quit dat!"</p>

<p>The battle being won, we had stopped for repairs
but there were still here and there some fitful
hostilities. For instance: Shorty had determined
that Harvie needed some cold water on
his bleeding nose and was rolling him into the
creek. Both of them were shouting and pommelling
each other as they rolled.</p>

<p>As they approached the large island where our
camp was pitched, Aunt Milly became very much
excited. Who were these vile wretches who had
accepted the hospitality of the Prices and then
turned against them, and while she, the natural
protector of the young master, was sleeping, had
well-nigh stripped him of his clothes and then
bloodied him all over with his own blue blood,
which was certainly flowing very redly?</p>

<p>"Hi, you! You little low flung, no 'count,
bench-legged trash! What you a-doin' ter Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Harbie?" she called to the all-unconscious
Shorty, who was having the time of his life as
he and his friend wallowed in the water, wrestling
as they swam.</p>

<p>But Aunt Milly saw no joke in such doings.
She looked around for something to use as a
weapon and spied the camp fire where the corn
and potatoes were being prepared to fulfill their
mission. They were done to a turn by that tune
and the fire had died down to a bed of red embers.
The old woman grabbed from the ashes a great
yam and with an aim that astonished one, she
threw it and hit Shorty a sounding whack on his
back.</p>

<p>"Wow!" yelled that young warrior.</p>

<p>"You'd better wow! An' don' you lan' here;
you go back ter dem Injuns whar you come
wid."</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Milly! What on earth?"
gasped Harvie as he saw the old woman stooping
for more ammunition.</p>

<p>"Yo' ol' Milly gwine he'p you, dat's what!"
She aimed another at the astonished Shorty, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that young man turned himself into a submarine
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Harvie clambered out of the water spluttering
and laughing. His nose had stopped bleeding
now and the water had washed off all traces of
the gory disaster. He caught the rampant Milly
by the arm:</p>

<p>"Aunt Milly, it's all a joke, a game! Nobody
was abusing me. Don't throw away the potatoes,
we are so hungry."</p>

<p>"Lawsamussy, chile! You can't fool this ol'
nigger. I's seen folks a-playin' an' I's a-seen
folks a-fightin', an' if'n that there warn't a battle
royal, I neber seed one."</p>

<p>By this time all of us were headed for camp.
As we came ashore her expression was still a belligerent
one and she had a hot potato which she
tossed from hand to hand ready for an emergency.</p>

<p>It took all the tact the Tuckers could muster
among them to convince Aunt Milly that we had
not been fighting, and even after she seemed to
be convinced, she growled a bit when Shorty appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
all dressed and spruce, with his hair
plastered down tight and his arm linked in Harvie's.
She had the fidelity of some old dog for
its master and it would take some time to erase
from her mind and heart that terrible scene of
Mr. Harbie being beaten and blooded and
pitched into the water.</p>

<p>We led her back to her seat in the sand and
brought her dinner to her. We would not let
her help cook or serve, but treated her like a real
chaperone and waited on her right royally. She
rolled her eyes a bit when to Shorty was relegated
the task of taking her a cup of coffee. He
pretended to be very much frightened and trembled
violently as he handed her the brimming
cup.</p>

<p>"Aunt Milly, how did you learn how to throw
so well? You hit me with that potato just as
though you belonged to a baseball nine."</p>

<p>"I been a-practicin' all my life a-throwin' at
rats," she growled.</p>

<p>This brought down the house.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TANGLEFOOT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A sufficient</span> time having elapsed since dinner,
we decided to go in swimming again; at least
the Tuckers decided to and all of us followed suit
(bathing suit!). Aunt Milly was becoming accustomed
to the ways of her charges and gave her
gracious consent when we humbly asked it. She
even stopped rolling her eyes at Shorty when she
saw that Harvie was not injured, after all, and
that he himself bore no malice towards his friend.</p>

<p>Mary, too, had something to do with mollifying
the old woman. She went and sat on the
sand bank by her side and explained to her how
the battle royal started and what fun it had been.
Of course ever since the circus, Mary had been a
great favorite with all the servants. They looked
upon her as a real celebrity. Mary had so many
stunts and was always so willing to amuse persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that she was constantly being called on to do
her dog fight or get off a feat of ventriloquism or
something else.</p>

<p>"Aunt Milly, if you forgive poor Mr. Hawkins
for bloodying up Mr. Harvie, I'll go like a
little pig caught under the gate for you."</p>

<p>"Lawsamussy, chil', kin you do that?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Will you forgive him if I do it?"</p>

<p>"Lemme hear you do it fust an' I'll see," said
Aunt Milly with a sly look. She was getting too
much capital out of the grudge she had against
Shorty to give it up too readily.</p>

<p>So Mary went through all the agony of a little
pig caught under the gate and even improved
upon it to the extent of introducing another character
into the act: she went like two pigs caught
under the gate.</p>

<p>Aunt Milly sat in her sand hole entranced.</p>

<p>"Well, bless Bob! If it ain't it to the life!
How you do it, honey?" So Mary had to do it
once more and then Aunt Milly promised to forgive
and forget.</p>

<p>"Come on and help clear up the remains of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
feast, Mary," insisted Dum, who was ever determined
that there should be no shirkers.</p>

<p>"I'm busy mollifying," declared Mary. "My
talents lie more in this direction," and she could
not help mimicking Jessie Wilcox just enough to
give Dum the dry grins. Jessie had not helped
at all about luncheon but had insisted that Aunt
Milly should be made to do whatever we had the
hardihood to suggest that she might do. Aunt
Milly, however, having been told that she was to
do no "wuck," did none, and presented a duck
back to all insinuations from the haughty Jessie.</p>

<p>"I don't care where your talents lie," insisted
Dum, "you are going to come help clear these
dishes off the cloth so I can fold it up."</p>

<p>Mary began to sing to a catchy tune this music-hall
ballad:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"I want to be a actress, a actress, a actress,</span><br />
I tell you I won't live and die a common serving gal.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I feel I've got the natur'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To act in a the-a-ter,</span><br />
I'm just the kind of stuff to make a star profession-a-l-l."<br />
</div>

<p>"Well, now ain't she cute?" and Aunt Milly
shook her fat sides with laughter. "She ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
ter say purty but she is sho' got a way wid her.
She ain't so handsome as some but she gonter
keep her takin' ways til' Kingdom Come, whilst
some folks what ain't nothin' but purty won' hab
nothin' lef' a tall whin the las' trump soun's. I
ain't a got no 'jections ter purty folks,&mdash;now that
there little Miss Annie Po' is sho' sweet lookin'
an' sweet tas'in', too, but she is wuth somethin'
sides. But some ain't." A glance of her rolling
eyes in the direction of Jessie gave us to understand
who "some" meant.</p>

<p>Jessie and Wink were having a most desperate
flirtation. He had not left her side a moment
during the whole day. Jessie glanced occasionally
in my direction with a little exultant toss of
her head as much as to say: "See, miss, I've got
your beau!" She was more than welcome to
him, but I didn't think it kind to lessen her delight
in her conquest, so I did my best to make
her happy by sighing deeply every time I caught
her looking at me.</p>

<p>The pleasure of going in swimming is going in
again, so as I said before, as soon as a reasonable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
time had elapsed since our very filling dinner we
again retired to our several tree-formed bath-houses
and donned our suits for a farewell
dip.</p>

<p>"No more fights now!" commanded Zebedee
sternly, just as though he had not been among
the mighty warriors of the last fray.</p>

<p>Tweedles promptly caught him and gave him
a good ducking until he yelled for mercy and
help from Aunt Milly, but that model chaperone
had gone off to sleep again and was deaf to his
cries.</p>

<p>"That's what you get for being Mr. Tuckerish,"
declared Dum.</p>

<p>Jessie Wilcox was a good swimmer but was
determined not to get her hair wet, so had not
entered very largely into our water sports.
Tweedles and Mary and I had lost our bathing
caps in the great naval battle, and since our heads
were already wet, we decided to get them wetter
and let our hair dry on the trip home. As for
Annie, getting her feet wet was about all she
could make up her mind to do, although her coils<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of honey-colored hair got a little damp. She
would take shuddering steps into the water and
when she got about knee-deep would lie down
and go through the motions of swimming with
one foot on the bottom. She had really learned
to keep up on top of the water at Willoughby the
summer before, but now had lost all confidence
in herself and was content just to paddle around
in the shallows.</p>

<p>From one side of our large island there
stretched a long narrow sand bar. The water
just trickled through there, while the great volume
of the creek flowed on the other side where
we were swimming. There were many shallow
spots where Annie could be perfectly safe, but
she decided to walk out on the sand bar and there
let down her hair and dry it in the sun. Her
cavaliers who seldom left her alone for a moment
happened to be engaged in some swimming
stunts just then, so unattended she crossed the
bar and, seating herself on the end of the neck of
sand, she let down her beautiful hair and spread
it out in the sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only look at Annie! Isn't she lovely?"
whispered Dum to me. "She looks like a mermaid
or a Rhine maiden."</p>

<p>"Please sing something, Annie!" I called.</p>

<p>"What shall I sing?" laughed Annie, combing
her hair with one of her side-combs and peeping
at me through its golden glory.</p>

<p>"Anything, so it has water in it!"</p>

<p>Annie's voice had grown in richness and volume
since the days at Gresham, although she had
had no lessons since that time. She had taken
advantage of the teaching she had received from
Miss Cox and kept up her practicing by herself
as best she could. Of course she should have
been under some good master, and all of us felt
indignant with Mr. Pore that he did not realize
this and make some arrangement for his daughter.
The outlay of money necessary for her musical
education would have been great, but the
returns would surely have been fourfold.
Everyone who heard Annie sing could not but
admire her voice. Even Jessie Wilcox praised
it, although that young lady was not inclined to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
think anybody but herself worthy of compliments.</p>

<p>The lovely thing about Annie was she was always
ready to be obliging, and if her singing
gave any pleasure, she was perfectly willing to
contribute it to the general welfare. She never
said she didn't have her music and could not sing
without notes; she never gave the excuse of not
being able to sing without accompaniment.
When Annie sang, her shyness left her. She
seemed to forget herself and lose all self-consciousness.
As her clear soprano notes arose on
the air, the noisy bathers quieted down and
everyone listened.</p>

"On the banks of Allan Water<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the sweet spring-time did fall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Was the miller's lovely daughter,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Fairest of them all.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For his bride a soldier sought her,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a winning tongue had he,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the banks of Allan Water,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">None so gay as she.</span><br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When brown autumn spreads his store,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There I saw the miller's daughter,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">But she smiled no more.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the summer grief had brought her,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the soldier false was he,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the banks of Allan Water,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">None so sad as she.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the miller's lovely daughter,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Both from cold and care was free;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the banks of Allan Water,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">There a corse lay she."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Bully!" exclaimed the audience.</p>

<p>"I'd like to meet that soldier," muttered
Sleepy.</p>

<p>"Please sing some more," begged Rags.</p>

<p>And so she sang again. Now she stood up,
took a few steps, and faced us as we paddled
around.</p>

<p>"Look what a big hole Annie made in the
sand, almost as big as Aunt Milly's," whispered
Dee to me.</p>

<p>"Yes, the sand must be awfully soft. I'm
glad it's not quicksand, though. That's so dangerous."
But what I knew about the dangers of
quicksand I kept to myself, as Annie had begun:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"To sea, to sea! The calm is o'er;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The wanton water leaps in sport,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And rattles down the pebbly shore;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The dolphin wheels, the sea-cow's snort,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And unseen mermaids' pearly song</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Comes bubbling up the weeds among&mdash;&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>And just then a strange thing happened:
Annie began to sink. The little sand island she
had chosen as a place of refuge where she might
dry her hair was evidently only an island in the
making, and the sand had not packed down. It
was quicksand, but not so quick as it might have
been, as she had been on it some minutes before it
began to give way under her weight. She looked
frightened and tried to pull her one foot up, but
it stuck. The last lines of her song were in a fair
way to be enacted before our very eyes if haste
was not made.</p>

<p>Annie gave a scream and made desperate
struggles to extricate herself. The swimmers
all started to her rescue, George Massie leading
the way, shooting through the water like a shark.</p>

<p>I clutched Zebedee as he went by me. "Get
the little brown boat and I'll help! The sand
may be dangerous all around there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a quick thinker and turned without a
word, landed on the big island and I followed.
We launched the little brown boat that we had
shoved up among the weeds and in a very short
time were floating out into deep water. With a
few strong strokes of the oars we had arrived at
the spot where we were in truth much needed.</p>

<p>Sleepy had grasped Annie, who was now engulfed
up to her knees. Of course he was about
the worst person among us to have got first to
her rescue because of his great weight. He gave
a tremendous pull, grasping Annie around her
waist. She came out of the sand making a noise
like a whole drove of cattle lifting their hoofs out
of the mud. Annie was perfectly limp with
fright. She clung to George Massie like some
little panic-stricken child.</p>

<p>The frantic Rags reached the sand bar immediately
behind Sleepy, and Harvie swam him a
close second. The water was quite deep within a
few feet of the fatal spot that the innocent Annie
had chosen as the best place to dry her hair. The
beach of quicksand shelved suddenly into swimming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
depth. As Harvie and Rags stepped from
this swimming hole into shallow water they realized
that they, too, had hurled themselves into
danger. They stuck fast.</p>

<p>Annie clung desperately to George. Her
eyes were closed and she was so pale I thought
she must have fainted. It was a few moments
before the rest of the party realized that the three
youths were being slowly sucked down. They
knew it, however, from the moment they touched
the bar.</p>

<p>"Throw Annie out into the water!" said Harvie
hoarsely. Annie had not fainted as I had
thought, for at these words she clung so desperately
to poor Sleepy that he could not loose her
hands.</p>

<p>Harvie reached over and unclasped them,
holding them tightly until Sleepy could raise her
up farther in his arms to throw her.</p>

<p>"Float, Annie! You can float!" shouted
Dee. "Do as I tell you!"</p>

<p>Annie, ever inclined to obedience, spread her
arms out as she struck the water and floated off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
as neatly as some well-built yacht launched for
the first time. Of course the others grabbed her
as soon as she got to them.</p>

<p>By this time Zebedee and I had the little
brown boat to the rescue. We came alongside
the poor stick-in-the-muds.</p>

<p>"Take Sleepy first!" cried the other two.
"He's in worse than we are."</p>

<p>Taking Sleepy first was no joke. He had
sunk at least a foot and a half. Zebedee tugged
at him and Sleepy tugged at himself. The little
boat almost capsized and still the young giant
could not pull his feet out of the treacherous
mire.</p>

<p>"You are not in far, Rags; come on and
help trim the boat," I insisted, paddling the
stern around in reach of Rags. He caught
hold and with a quick spring was in the
boat.</p>

<p>"Now, Harvie!" I commanded. "We can't
get Sleepy unless you come help." I knew perfectly
well that Harvie had a notion he must not
get in the boat until his friend was saved. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the meantime, Zebedee was struggling to raise
Sleepy and the boat was in sad need of ballast.
Harvie did as I bade him and with a mighty effort
extricated himself and landed in the boat.
The legs of both the boys were covered with mire
up to their knees.</p>

<p>All the time we were doing this, the rest of the
party was not idle. Of course some of them had
to look after the frightened Annie. Dum and
Billy Somers had struck out immediately for the
red boat which was beached on the far side of the
island, realizing as they soon did that the only
way to get the boys out of the quicksand was by
boat. Mary and Shorty also made for the canoe,
thinking it might be needed, too.</p>

<p>Glad we were when the red boat came alongside
of ours and we could lash them together to
make more purchase for Sleepy. The little
brown boat did not have weight enough to do the
job alone. And now with a long pull and a
strong pull and a pull all together, we at last got
him out.</p>

<p>If when Annie got her feet out of the sand she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
made a noise like a drove of cattle lifting their
hoofs out of the mud, you can fancy what the
noise was when Sleepy came out. It was like a
great ground swell, and so much water had that
young giant displaced, when he removed his bulk
I am sure the depth of the creek was perceptibly
lowered.</p>

<p>Now it was all over we could giggle, which
Dum and I did until Zebedee got really outdone
with us and threatened to box us both. It had
been a close shave and he felt it was not a time
for giggling, but Dum and I were no respecters
of time or place. When the giggles struck us,
giggle we must.</p>

<p>"If it had not been for your quickness, Page,
it might have been a very serious tragedy," he
said solemnly. "I never thought of the boats
but was going to swim to Annie's assistance."</p>

<p>"I have seen this quicksand before. I almost
lost one of my dogs several years ago. He
started out in the creek to get a stick I had
thrown for him and as soon as he touched the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sand he began to sink. I never heard such cries
as he gave trying to pull his feet out. I got two
fence-rails and crawled out to him and pulled
him in. Father nearly had a fit when I told him
about it. He sent men down and had the creek
dredged."</p>

<p>"I think we should put a sign up here," said
Harvie, and a few days later he did paint "Danger"
on a sign and came back to Croxton's Ford
and planted it at the fatal spot.</p>

<p>It had been a very trying experience, but
young people don't brood over things that might
have been serious. That is something left to the
so-called philosophy of old age. By the time we
were in dry clothes and on our way home, the
fact that some of our party had been in a fair way
to losing their lives seemed something to be joked
about.</p>

<p>Of course poor Sleepy came in for his share,
but much he cared. He stretched himself at
Annie's feet, and possessing himself of a little
corner of her sweater, which he clutched tightly
in his great hand just as a little baby might cling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to its mother's dress, he dropped off into a sleep
of exhaustion. He looked very peaceful and
happy as he lay there and Annie looked down on
his handsome head with affection and admiration
in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I know one thing," announced Rags; "I'll
never see sticky fly-paper again without thinking
of this day. I felt exactly like a poor fly stuck
fast in tanglefoot. I am sure my legs are a foot
longer than they were when I left Maxton this
morning." As Ben Raglan's legs were abnormally
long, we all devoutly hoped that the
stretching was not permanent. Proportioned
somewhat like a clothes-pin, he could not stand
much lengthening of limb.</p>

<p>"Shorty, it's too bad you weren't first aid man
this time," teased Harvie. "It might have made
a man of you. All you need is a good stretching."</p>

<p>"Wait until I get you where Aunt Milly can't
help you and I'll give you the pounding you
need," answered the boy, as he paddled the canoe
in the wake of the launch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Milly was comfortably ensconced in the
seat of honor, sleeping the sleep of the just and
generous chaperone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A YOUNGER SON</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> found Miss Maria much improved but still
bed-ridden. She said Wink's medicine was the
most efficacious she had ever had, as it had given
her a day of rest free from pain. I fancy the
quiet had done her as much good as the medicine.
She regretted to report that Mr. Pore had telephoned
a peremptory message to the effect that
Annie should come home the first thing in the
morning and bring her clothes.</p>

<p>"Now isn't that the limit?" stormed Dum.
"What on earth can he want? We haven't but
three more days here and it seems to me he
might&mdash;&mdash;" But Annie looked so pained that
Dum didn't say what he might do.</p>

<p>"He needs me, I fancy," said Annie sadly.</p>

<p>"So do we need you! And how about Sleepy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and Harvie and Rags?" But Annie didn't know
how about them, so she only blushed.</p>

<p>"Maybe you can come back," I suggested.</p>

<p>"No, I fancy not, or why should he say I must
bring my clothes?"</p>

<p>All of us were at a loss to fathom the behavior
of Mr. Pore, but we were too tired to discuss it
farther. We were thankful for the time we had
been able to wrest Annie from his selfish demands.
I was sorry, indeed, that Zebedee had
attended to his old freight for him. I heartily
agreed with Dum's sentiments which she muttered
under her breath:</p>

<p>"Pig!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, we are going down with you," declared
Mary.</p>

<p>"But I must go before breakfast," said Annie.</p>

<p>"Well, we can travel on an empty stomach
quite as well as you can and a great deal weller,"
insisted Dum, and Dee and Mary and I agreed.</p>

<p>"Please don't awaken me," said Jessie as she
twisted her hair into the patent curlers that she
managed so well nobody but a girl could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
told that her curls were not natural. "I certainly
want to sleep in the morning. Dr. White
begged me to go rowing with him before breakfast,
but I can't bear to get up so early in the
morning. It seemed to distress him terribly but
then he is such a flirt one can never tell." All
this with many glances in my direction.</p>

<p>We had gathered in the room occupied by
Tweedles and Jessie for a little chat before turning
in for the night.</p>

<p>"How cr-u-le!" exclaimed Mary. "What
makes you think he is such a flirt?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that would be telling!" and Jessie began
dabbing on the cold cream.</p>

<p>It is strange how indifferent some girls are to
what other girls think of them. Jessie Wilcox,
the most careful person in the world to look well
when any males were around, did not mind in the
least letting us see her with her hair twisted up
in little wads and clasped with innumerable arrangements
made of wire covered with leather.
The things looked like huge ticks sticking out
from her head, not such a shapely head, either,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
now that one saw it with the hair drawn back so
tightly. Cold cream may be a future beautifier
but certainly not a present one. She laid it on
in generous hunks and then massaged herself,
contorting her countenance in a most disconcerting
manner.</p>

<p>"I don't think Wink is a flirt at all," said Dee
stoutly. "He is a very good friend of mine and
I reckon I know him about as well as anybody in
the world. Of course he will flirt if it is up to
him, but that is not making him a flirt."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" and Jessie began rubbing cocoa
butter on her neck. "Perhaps you don't know
the flirtatious side of him."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness, I don't. He and I talk
sense to each other," and Dee scornfully sniffed
the air. She and Dum hated the odor of cocoa
butter, declaring it made their room smell like an
apothecary's shop.</p>

<p>"Why don't you and Dum come in our room
for to-night?" I suggested, scenting mischief as
well as cocoa butter in the air, since the usually
tactful Dee was on the war-path. "You will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
sure to disturb Jessie in the morning if you sleep
in here. Come on! I'll sleep three in the bed
with you and get in the middle at that," and so
they came, expressing themselves privately as
glad to get away from their roommate, who did
smell so of cocoa butter and also looked so hideous
with her hair done up in those tick-like arrangements
and her face shiny with grease.</p>

<p>"Cat! What does she mean by calling Wink
a flirt?" raged Dee, who was surely a loyal
friend.</p>

<p>"Maybe he is one," suggested Dum.</p>

<p>"Virginia Tucker, I am tired unto death but
I'll challenge you to a boxing match if you say
that again."</p>

<p>"You are no more tired than I am and I'll say
it again!" maintained Dum. "All I said was:
'Maybe he is,' and maybe he is!" No one of the
name of Tucker ever took a dare, and the twins
crawled out of the great bed where I had taken
my place in the middle.</p>

<p>"Girls! Girls! You are so silly," I cried
wearily. "You haven't your boxing gloves and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
you know you might beat each other up with your
bare fists. This is no fighting matter, Dee, at
least nothing to fight Dum about. Go fight
Jessie Wilcox! She is the one who has the proof
of Wink's ways."</p>

<p>We were relieved that my reasoning powers
quelled the disturbance. Tweedles got back into
bed. The twins very rarely resorted to trial by
combat now. It had been their childish method
of settling difficulties, as their father had brought
them up like boys whose code of honor is to stop
fussing and fight it out.</p>

<p>"I can't see why you think it is such an awful
thing to call Wink a flirt," I said, when all danger
of a battle had subsided. "You certainly
flirt sometimes yourself."</p>

<p>"When?" indignantly.</p>

<p>"When you sell coffins to healthy young
farmers," I asserted.</p>

<p>No more from Dee that night.</p>

<p>We were up early the next morning to escort
Annie home, so early that no one was stirring,
not even the servants. It seemed ridiculous for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
her to go so early, but the message from her
father was one not to be lightly ignored. She
had told Miss Maria and the general good-by the
night before and Harvie was to drive her home,
but when we crept downstairs there was no Harvie
to be found; so we made our way out to the
stable where Mary and I hitched up. As we
drove off, all five of us crowded into a one-seated
buggy, we beheld a very sleepy Harvie waving
frantically from the boys' wing and vainly entreating
us to wait; but we weren't waiting for
sleepy-heads that morning, and drove pitilessly
away.</p>

<p>There was an air of bustling in the store when
we piled out of our small buggy. Mr. Pore was
in his shirt sleeves, his glasses set at a rakish angle
on his aristocratic nose and an unaccustomed
flush on his usually pale countenance. He was
busy pulling things off of the shelves and piling
them up on the counters. The clerk (he called
him a "clark," of course, after the manner of
Englishmen), was just as busy.</p>

<p>To my amazement I heard Mr. Pore say to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
little boy who had been sent to the store on a
hurry call for matches: "Haven't time to wait on
you; go over to Blinker's."</p>

<p>What did this mean? Actually sending customers
to the rival store!</p>

<p>"Father!" exclaimed Annie, as Mr. Pore gave
her his usual pecky kiss. "I didn't know you
were going to take stock to-day."</p>

<p>"Neither did I, my dear." His tone was a bit
softer than I had ever heard it. And "my
dear"! I had never heard him call Annie that
before.</p>

<p>"What is it, Father?"</p>

<p>"I have news from England."</p>

<p>"Not bad news, I hope!"</p>

<p>"Well, yes! I might call it bad news."</p>

<p>"Oh, Father, I am so sorry!"</p>

<p>"Ahem! My brother, the late baronet, is&mdash;er&mdash;no
more."</p>

<p>"You mean Uncle Isaac is dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"What was the matter? When did you
hear?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"A cablegram states he was killed in a recent
battle," and Mr. Pore went on making neat piles
on the counter with cans of salmon. I wanted
to shake him for more news that I felt sure he
had.</p>

<p>Annie took off her hat and tied on an apron
ready to help in the arduous task of taking stock.
Tweedles and Mary and I stood in the doorway
as dumb as fish. Why should a man whose
brother had recently died in England feel a necessity
of taking stock in a country store? It
was too much for us. Suddenly it flashed
through my brain that maybe Mr. Pore was going
to England. His brother, Sir Isaac Pore,
had a son, so Annie had told me, who was, of
course, in line for the title.</p>

<p>Mr. Pore finished with the salmon and then
spoke with his usual pomposity: "The message
also states that my brother's only son has met
with an untimely death in the Dardanelles."</p>

<p>Annie dropped a box of soap and stood looking
with big eyes at her father.</p>

<p>"I find it necessary that we go to England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and before we go, I deem it advisable to make an
inventory of our goods and chattels."</p>

<p>"Go to England! When?" gasped Annie.</p>

<p>"I fancy we can arrange to be off in about a
week."</p>

<p>This was news that touched all of us. Annie
going to England! We might never see her
again, and her dried-up old father was standing
there announcing this fact with as much composure
as though he had decided to move his store
across the road or do something else equally ordinary.</p>

<p>"You see," he continued with his grandiloquent
manner, "the demise of my brother and
his son, who is unmarried, advance me to the baronetcy,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you are Sir Arthur Ponsonby Pore!"
blurted out Dum.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" he announced calmly, as though
he had been inheriting titles all his life.</p>

<p>"Is Annie Lady Anna then?" asked Mary.</p>

<p>"No, she is still Miss Pore. Only a son inherits
a title from a baronet," he said with a trace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of bitterness. I remembered what Annie had
told me of her brother's death and her father's
resentment of her being a girl.</p>

<p>"Well, she would make a lovely Lady Annie
all the same," said Dee. "I bet everybody
in England will just about go crazy about
her."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" was his supercilious remark to
this effusion.</p>

<p>"We are going to come down and help you,
Annie," I whispered. "I know there are lots of
things we can do. You will need help about
your clothes. I can't sew, but I can count
clothes-pins and chewing-gum while you sew.
Don't you want us to help, Mr. Pore?"</p>

<p>That gentleman was as usual quite dumbfounded
by being treated like an ordinary human
being, and with some hemming and hawing he
finally acknowledged that our assistance would
be acceptable. His idea was to sell his business
and stock to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>Great was the consternation and surprise at
Maxton when we announced the choice bit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
news that we had picked up that morning before
breakfast. Sleepy looked as though he might
have apoplexy, his face got so red and his hand
trembled so. Harvie got pale and suddenly
realized that Annie was not just a little sister.
Poor Rags put maple syrup in his coffee and
cream on his waffle in the excitement occasioned
by the unwelcome news.</p>

<p>They were at breakfast when we burst in on
them, at breakfast and rather sore with all of us
for having run off without them. Jessie was
holding the fort alone, the only female present,
as Miss Maria was still unable to get up. That
beautiful young lady was looking lovelier than
ever in a crisp handkerchief-linen frock. Her
curls were very curly and her lovely brunette
complexion not at all the worse for the scorching
sun of the day before. My poor nose had six
more freckles than when I came to Maxton, six
more by actual count, and there was not room for
the extra ones at all. Mary's freckles were like
the stars in the sky, every time you looked you
could find another; Dee had her share, too; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Dum had begun to peel as was her habit. Jessie
was pretty, very pretty, but the picture of her
with her face all greased up and the tick-like
curlers covering her head would arise whenever I
looked at her.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't Mr. Pore leave Annie here with
us until the submarine warfare is over with?"
asked Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>"We never thought of suggesting it," tweedled
the twins.</p>

<p>"I did think of it but I knew she wouldn't be
willing to have Sir Arthur go alone," I said,
rather proud of myself for being the first one to
give him his title.</p>

<p>"How much more suited he is to being a member
of English aristocracy than engaging in mercantile
pursuits in America," laughed the general.
"I only wish his lovely wife might have
shared the honor with him. Ah me, what a
woman she was!"</p>

<p>"He was mighty cold and clammy about his
brother's death," said Dee. "When Annie asked
if it was bad news he had he said he might call it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
bad news; but his tone was far from convincing."</p>

<p>"He hasn't seen his brother for over twenty
years and he rowed with all his family before he
left England, so I reckon it was hard to squeeze
out many tears over his death. I felt awful bad
about the poor young son," and Dum looked
ready to shed tears herself without having to resort
to the squeezing process. "'An untimely
death in the Dardanelles!' That sounds so
tragic."</p>

<p>"Yes, that made me feel like crying, too," said
Dee. "Just think of a splendid young Englishman,
handsome and brave and charming, being
shot to pieces by German bullets! I have an
idea he had succeeded to the title and estates only
a few days before, and while he was sad about
his father, he still was looking forward to being
the baronet when he got home."</p>

<p>"What makes you think he was handsome?"
put in the more matter-of-fact Mary.</p>

<p>"I am sure he must have looked like Annie,
and just think what a wonderfully handsome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
man he must have been! He had her lovely hair,
I almost know he did, and great blue eyes and a
strong, straight back," and Dum wiped her own
eyes that would fill when she thought of
the splendid young Englishman gone to his
death.</p>

<p>"I don't like to break in on this grand orgy of
feeling," I said, "but you must remember that
Annie got her looks from her mother, as her father
had none to spare. This poor young man
may have been all the things you girls picture
him to be, but he is just as likely to have inherited
his looks from Uncle Arthur Ponsonby. He
may have had no chin at all and have had champagne-bottle
shoulders and a long neck."</p>

<p>"Page, how can you? Don't you know that
people who meet untimely deaths in the Dardanelles
are always brave and handsome?" teased
Zebedee. "For my part, I am sorrier for the
present baronet, Sir Arthur, than for the late
lamenteds. Only think how far the poor man has
drifted from all the manners and customs of his
race!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not manners, maybe customs! His manners
are quite the thing to go with titles, I think.
As for Annie,&mdash;she has a way with her that will
make her shine in any society," I asserted.</p>

<p>Everyone agreed with me audibly but Jessie.
She had not yet adjusted herself to look upon
Annie as anything but the badly-dressed
daughter of a country storekeeper, who could
sing better than she could and had attracted three
out of the nine beaux on the house-party.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SLEEPY WAKES UP</div>


<p><span class="smcap">House-parties</span> have to end sometime and the
one at Maxton was no exception. We had been
invited for two weeks, and although Miss Maria
graciously asked us to extend the time of our
stay, we felt that the old lady had had enough of
high jinks for a while. We had become very
fond of her and I think she liked us, too. The
general was in love with the whole bunch, he declared.
He made his gallant, bromidic speeches
to each one in turn, playing no favorites.</p>

<p>"If I were fifty years younger I would show
these chaps a thing or two," he would say.</p>

<p>My private opinion was that the chaps did not
need a thing or two shown them, as they seemed
quite on to the fact that Maxton was a romantic
spot and that there is no time like the present for
getting off tender nothings. There being Jacks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to go around for the Jills and some to spare, if
there were any heartaches they were among the
males, as there were no wallflowers among the
girls.</p>

<p>If the death of Sir Isaac Pore and his son and
heir did not cause overmuch grief in the heart
of the storekeeper at Price's Landing, it had a
dire effect on three young men in the great house
on the hill. The only way in which they could
give vent to their feelings was in heroic attempts
to assist in the inventory of the stock.
That meant at least that they could be near
Annie and gain her gratitude. Annie's gratitude
was not a difficult thing to gain. She was
in a state of perpetual astonishment that all of
us loved her so much.</p>

<p>"What have I done to make all of you so kind
to me?" she would ask. And the answer would
be:</p>

<p>"Everything, in that you are your own sweet
self."</p>

<p>Mr. Pore, or rather Sir Arthur, seemed to
think we were helping in the shop because of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
admiration and respect for him, and since he
thus flattered himself we let him go on thinking
so, and even encouraged him in this delusion
since it simplified matters for all of us. Sleepy
even sneaked the daughter off on a lovely long
buggy ride while Dum checked up a shelf full of
dry-goods, supposed to be done by Annie.</p>

<p>The seemingly impossible was accomplished
and that before we left Maxton: a complete inventory
of the stock of a crowded country store
was made and in order, all because of the many
helpers. A purchaser was found by the expeditious
Zebedee, and everything, including the
good will, sold, lock, stock, and barrel, at a very
good price considering the haste of the transaction.</p>

<p>Annie and her father actually did get off
within the week. How it was accomplished I
can't see, and as we had left Maxton before they
made their getaway I shall never know. Harvie,
who was the only one of us left, said that Sir
Arthur was as standoffish and superior as ever.
He started on his journey with the same old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Gladstone bag and, as far as Harvie could make
out, the same English clothes he had brought to
Price's Landing all those years and years ago.</p>

<p>"If they weren't the same, where on earth
could he have bought any like them? They don't
make them in this country," he said, when he
told me of it.</p>

<p>Harvie, having awakened to the fact that
Annie was a very charming, beautiful girl, whom
he had for years looked upon as a kind of sister
but who was not a sister and was moreover very
much admired by other members of his sex, now
was making up for lost time as fast as possible.
He had no feeling of <i>noblesse oblige</i> in regard to
Sleepy. He surely had as much right to love
Annie as George Massie had and more right to
tell her of it, since she was almost his sister. He
hovered around her to the last, doing a million
little things to help her and assuring her in the
meantime of his undying affection, but Annie
never did seem to understand that he was being
any more than a big brother to her. Never having
had a big brother, she did not know that big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
brothers do not as a rule express their love for the
little sisters in such glowing terms.</p>

<p>George Massie went gloomily off when the
house-party broke up. He felt that he could not
in decency stay longer at Maxton since all the
others were leaving, although he longed to be
near Annie. He sought me out on the boat when
we were bound for Richmond and sighing like a
furnace sank down by my side. If it had been a
sailboat we were traveling in instead of an old
side-wheel steamboat, I am sure the great sigh
he heaved would have sent us faster on our way.</p>

<p>"Something fierce!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is hard, but maybe they will come
back sometime, or perhaps when you get your
degree you can go over to England and see her."</p>

<p>"Get my degree! Do you think I am going
back to the University? Not on your life!"</p>

<p>"But what will you do? You must have some
ambition," I said rather severely.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've got ambition all right; I'm going
to do my bit in France as stretcher bearer. I decided
last night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Sure! I'm just wasting my time at the University.
I talked it out with Annie. She has
lots of feeling about England and the war, and if
she cares, then it is up to me to help her country
some."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sleepy! I think that is just splendid
of you," I cried. "When will you go?"</p>

<p>"Ahem&mdash;I'm thinking of going on the same
boat with Mr.&mdash;Sir Arthur Pore."</p>

<p>I could not help laughing.</p>

<p>"Does Annie know?"</p>

<p>"No, I was afraid she might make some objection.
I think I'll just surprise her on the
steamer."</p>

<p>"Won't you have to get passports and permits
and things before you can go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll set the ball rolling as soon as I get
to Richmond. Mr. Tucker is attending to Sir
Arthur's and I guess I'll go see him as soon as
we land. He knows how to do so many things."</p>

<p>That was certainly so. Mr. Jeffry Tucker not
only could and would match zephyr for old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
ladies, but he knew just how to get passports
for pompous English noblemen who had but recently
kept country stores on the banks of the
river, and for the lovely daughters. He also
knew how to get rushed-through passports for
rich young medical students who had taken sudden
resolutions to do a bit in France because of
a kind of vicarious patriotism.</p>

<p>George Massie had a busy week. He must
rush off to see his people, who no doubt were
quite confounded by his unwonted energy. He
must get the proper clothing for his undertaking
and also make his will, since he had quite an estate
in his own name. He must tell many relations
farewell and explain as best he could his
sudden passion for carrying the wounded off of
the battle fields.</p>

<p>When he came in to tell the Tuckers good-by
before he went to New York to embark on the
steamer with the unsuspecting Pores, he looked
almost thin and quite wide awake, so they told
me.</p>

<p>The Tuckers had tried to persuade me to wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in Richmond with them for a few days before going
to Bracken so that together we could see the
last of our little English friend, for Sir Arthur
and Annie were to take a train in Richmond for
New York. But I had been too long away from
my father and felt that I must hasten home to
him.</p>

<p>Needless to say that Zebedee had the passports
all ready for them to sign and berths engaged on
the New York sleeper and passage on an English
vessel, sailing the following Saturday.</p>

<p>Tweedles told me that Annie clung to them
at parting as though they had been a life rope.
The poor girl felt that she was going into a
strange cold world. It must have been even worse
for her than the memorable time when she started
on what she thought was going to be that lonesome,
forlorn journey to Gresham. That trip
had proven to be very enjoyable in spite of all
her fears; and perhaps this journey across the
ocean was not going to be so very forlorn, either.</p>

<p>I should not relish much the idea of a trip
with Sir Arthur Ponsonby Pore. I can fancy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
his aloof manner with fellow passengers, who
perhaps were seeking acquaintance with his
lovely daughter; his disregard for the comfort of
others; his haughtiness with the steward. The
only way to travel in peace with the baronet
would be to have him get good and seasick before
the vessel got out of sight of Sandy Hook,
and stay so until she was docked at Liverpool.
Then he might prove a very pleasant traveling
companion, provided he was so ill that he had to
stay in his bunk.</p>

<p>Of course as the days passed we became desperately
uneasy about Annie. It seemed a perfect
age since they had sailed and still no news
of the safe arrival of the vessel. I was at
Bracken, away from the constant calling of extras
that was the rule in the city during those
stirring war times. Tweedles told me they
rushed out in the night to purchase a paper every
time an extra was called, fearing news of a disaster
to the <i>Lancaster</i>, the old-fashioned wooden
boat the Pores had taken.</p>

<p>Zebedee had promised to telephone to them if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
news came to his paper concerning the steamer,
news either of disaster or safety. The following
is the letter I received from Dee written in the
excitement of a message but that moment received
from her father.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>
<i>Richmond, Va.</i><br />
</div>

<span class="smcap">Dearest Page:</span>

<p>Zebedee has just cabled me that he has
had a telephone message from Liverpool that a
mine had struck the <i>Lancaster</i> about five hours
out from port and the open boats had to take to
the passengers. All on board were saved although
some of the passengers were much shaken
up. (I hope Arthur Ponsonby was one of the
much shaken.) We are greatly excited about
poor Annie. She is so afraid of water. It is
feared all baggage is lost. (Good-by to the
Gladstone bag!)</p>

<p>Dum and I can hardly wait for the cable that
we just know Sleepy will send us as soon as he
can. Aren't we glad, though, that Sleepy was
along? He will take care of Annie no matter
what happens. It may be weeks and months before
we can get a letter from Annie, telling us all
about it. We are awfully sorry it should have
happened to Annie, but Dum and Zebedee and
I just wish we had been along. I bet you do, too!</p>

<p>These times are so stirring, I don't see how we
can all of us sit still. If our country ever gets
pulled into the mix-up I tell you I'm going to
get in the dog fight, too. Zebedee says he is, too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and so is Dum. I want to study veterinary surgery
so I can help the poor horses when they get
wounded and look after the dear dogs who work
so hard to bring in the wounded. Zebedee is
afraid that is man's work but I tell him bosh!
plain bosh! There is no such thing as man's
work any more in this world. He says I'm an
emancipated piece and I tell him I'm glad he
realizes it. Dum and I are hard at work at war
relief work. We go three times a week and roll
bandages. I like the work but Dum sits up and
lets tears drop on the bandages, thinking about
all the poor soldiers they are to bind up. I cry
a little, too, sometimes. Zebedee says if we bawl
over new bandages, what would we do over real
wounds? I tell him salt is a good antiseptic and
a few sincere tears won't hurt the poor wounded.</p>

<p>Dum and I have adopted a French war orphan
between us. Ten cents keeps one for a day and it
does seem mean of us not to give that much. We
always waste that much money, and more, every
day of our lives. It means only letting up a bit
on the movies or drinking water instead of limeade
when one is thirsty. Zebedee has got himself
one all by himself and he is going to keep it
by letting up on one cigar a day. He says his
smoke is bitter to him now that he realizes that
every time he lights a ten cent cigar he might be
feeding a little Belgian baby. We offered to get
him some rabbit tobacco and dry it nicely so he
could smoke it in a pipe, but he said never mind.
Poor Zebedee is so choosey about his smoke that
he would rather give it up altogether than not
have it good.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>We've got a scheme on hand for a jaunt but
I'm going to let Zebedee have the pleasure of
springing it on you if the plan works out. Dum
says I'm not leaving a thing for her to tell. She
says it is not ethical for one member of a family
to write such a long letter to a person that other
members correspond with, but I tell her I have
told you very little news and that my letter has
been more taken up with psychology and the
conduct of life.</p>

<p>Of course I started this letter to tell you about
Annie and the good ship <i>Lancaster</i>, but since all
I know about it is that it hit a mine and all hands
were saved in open boats I could not enlarge on
that bit of news much. We will let you know
when we hear more.</p>

<p>Zebedee and Dum and Brindle send you much
love. Give mine to Dr. Allison and Mammy
Susan, also many hugs to the dogs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THINGS HAPPENING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the delights of leaving home is coming
back, at least so I always felt about my beloved
Bracken. I indulged in many little jaunts during
the summer but each home-coming was as
pleasant as the trips. First there had been the
house-party at Maxton, which had been so full
of good times, then a short stay at home and almost
before I had settled myself, a hurry call
from the Tuckers to go to a mountain camp run
by some very spunky girls from Richmond, the
Carters.</p>

<p>Those days in camp were a delightful experience
and quite an eye-opener as to what girls
can do if it is up to them. The Carter girls had
been brought up in extravagant luxury, but
when their father had a nervous breakdown and
they suddenly found themselves with no visible
means of support, they jumped in and ran a
week-end boarding camp on the side of a mountain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in Albemarle, and actually supported the
whole family and made some money besides.</p>

<p>They were the busiest people I ever saw, but
they managed to tuck in a lot of fun along with
it. I certainly hope to see more of those girls,
as they interested me tremendously. Douglas
was the oldest; she seemed to be the balance
wheel for the family. I never saw such poise
in a young girl,&mdash;not a bit "society," either. She
had given up college and was going to stay at
home and help. Helen was the next, a stylish
creature with more clash and swing to her than
even my beloved Tweedles. She was the one
who directed the cooking as though she had been
catering to boarders all her life, and I was told
that she had never thought of such a thing until
the spring before, when her father got ill. She
evidently had no head for money and I am afraid
had an extravagant way with her that gave poor
Douglas some trouble.</p>

<p>Then came Nan, a perfect love of a little
thing, all poetry and charm but with a conscience
that made her do her duty in spite of preferring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to live in the clouds. Lucy was the
youngest girl and showed promise of being perhaps
the best-looking of all the very handsome
sisters, but she was too young to say for certain.
At any rate, she was a very attractive child.
Then there was Bobby, the little brother, an <i>enfant
terrible</i> and a perfect little duck.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was the most pathetic figure I have
ever seen: a big, strong man, accustomed to action
and power, reduced to letting his daughters
make a living for him. He seemed to have lost
the power of concentration, somehow. Mr.
Tucker said he thought he would get well but it
was going to take a long time. He had worked
beyond mental endurance trying to keep his
family in luxury.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter was the kind of woman who reconciles
one to being a half-orphan, not that my little
mother would ever have been that kind, but I
mean it is better to be motherless than to have the
kind she was. I thought she was very pretty,
very gracious, with a wonderful social gift, but
the kind of woman who flops at the first breath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of disaster. Those Carter girls will have her on
their hands just like a baby until the end of time.
Whenever she was crossed, she simply went to
bed in a ravishing boudoir cap and bed sacque
and there she lolled until she carried her point.</p>

<p>The Carters were so interesting to me that I
should like to tell more about them but they
really should be in a book all to themselves, they
and their week-end camp. I had never been right
in the mountains before, but after my stay among
them I felt that I liked it even better than the
seashore. Father said that the last wonderful
thing I saw was always the most wonderful thing
in the world. He also said that that was just as
it should be. That when persons begin to look
backward all the time instead of forward, the sutures
of their skulls are too firmly knit together
and all of their pleasures have to be of memory.
New things make no impression on their brains.
He said he intended to keep his skull in a semi-pliable
state like a baby's and go on looking at
the world as a rattle for him to have a good time
with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>I had often thought that my dear father spent
a terribly humdrum existence for a man of his
ability and intense interest in current events.
While I loved the country in general and
Bracken in particular, I also loved to get out
into the world occasionally and get a new outlook,
a different view-point as it were; get somewhere
where things were happening. Nothing
much ever seemed to me to happen in the country.</p>

<p>One day I said as much to him. He smiled
and drew me to him.</p>

<p>"Why, honey, things are happening all the
time in the country just as much as in town. I
like to get away occasionally, too, but not because
I want to be where things are happening,&mdash;in
fact, I like to get away from so many things happening
at once as they do in my life here as a
country doctor. The things that happen in cities
I feel more impersonal about."</p>

<p>"But you like to read about the things that
happen in cities."</p>

<p>"Yes, and city people like to read about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
things that happen in the country, too. Aren't
all the popular magazines filled with stories of
rural life?"</p>

<p>"Ye-s! But they are romances that are made
up."</p>

<p>"But not made up out of whole cloth! Come
and go with me to-day on my rounds."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd love to, but Miss Pinkie Davis has
come to sew for me and I have to be here to
help."</p>

<p>"Let her stay and we will give her a holiday.
Poor Miss Pinkie has precious few holidays.
She can read all the new magazines and rest her
busy fingers."</p>

<p>Of course Miss Pinkie was agreeable to the
arrangement. She did have very few holidays
and no time to read the romances she craved.
We left her ensconced in a hammock on the
shady porch with a pile of magazines beside her
and a beatific smile on her paper doll countenance.
Something interesting was already
happening in the country, at least something interesting
to Miss Pinkie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a wonderful day in late September.
The winter corn had been cut and stacked in
shocks that always reminded me of Indian wigwams.
The tobacco had been housed the week
before and now from each tobacco barn arose a
mist of blue smoke. Groups of men could be
seen standing around every barn gathered there
to take part in the sacred rite of curing the green
tobacco. A steady fire must be kept up day and
night, and all the men in the countryside seemed
to feel it could not be done without the personal
supervision of each and every one of them.</p>

<p>"Suppose the women had some important
steady cooking to do where the fire had to be kept
up day and night, do you think they would have
to call in all the other women in the county to
assist?" laughed Father. "Men are funny animals."</p>

<p>"The tobacco crop was pretty good, wasn't
it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Fine! Never saw a better. I guess many a
poor soldier in the trenches will be thankful that
it is so. They say this war is being fought on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
wheat and tobacco crops." I thought Father
gave me a sly glance, but when I asked him what
he was looking at he said nothing much, he only
thought my nose was growing a little.</p>

<p>Everybody had a word of greeting for Dr. Allison
as we drove by. We were stopped again
and again, sometimes for a word of advice from
the family physician as to Jim's sore throat or
Mary's indigestion; sometimes to prescribe for
a hog or cow that was indisposed, and once to
decide if San Jose scale had attacked a peach
orchard. We could not stop long with each person
as we were on a hurry call, but Father always
had a moment to spare; and then the colt
had to make up for lost time and was given free
rein at every good stretch of road.</p>

<p>The colt was the colt by courtesy and habit.
He had long ago passed the skittish age, but his
spirit was one of eternal youth and his ways so
coltish that no other name seemed to suit him.
One could as soon think of Cupid's growing up
to be an old gentleman as the colt's ever becoming
a safe, steady nag. Enough things happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in the country for him, and he thought that each
thing that happened was something for him to
dance and prance about. A flock of belated
blackbirds twittering in an oak tree was enough
to make him get the bit in his teeth and run a
quarter of a mile. A rabbit running across the
road was something to shy over,&mdash;and I agree
with the colt in that. As many times as I have
seen it, there is something about a Molly Cottontail
as she lopes across the road that always
startles me. She bobs up so suddenly from nowhere
and disappears as rapidly into the nowhere.</p>

<p>Driving the colt was an excitement in itself
that must have kept life from becoming dull to
my dear father. There could be no loafing on
that job. Reins had to be well up in hand and
the driver must be fully cognizant of things that
the imaginative animal no doubt looked upon as
possible enemies. Sometimes I think he was
playing a game with himself and making excitement
to keep his existence from being humdrum.
At any rate, it was great fun to be behind the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
spirited animal on that crisp September morn.
No one could drive so well as Father. He had a
sure, steady, gentle but firm touch on the rein
that soothed the most nervous horse. Father's
driving always reminded me of Zebedee's dancing.</p>

<p>Our hurry call was to a young farmer's wife.
The gates were wide open as though we were
expected and no obstacles were to delay us. The
husband, Henry Miller, was waiting for us at
the stile block. His face was drawn and white
and great tears were rolling down his weather-beaten
cheeks.</p>

<p>"She's awful bad off, Doctor. I'm afraid
she's gonter die," he whispered huskily.</p>

<p>"Oh no, my son! I have no idea of such a
thing. Maybe you had better unhitch my horse.
He is not much on the stand. Page, you help
him, please."</p>

<p>Now Father knew perfectly well that I could
look after the colt by myself, but he simply
wanted to occupy Mr. Miller. Silently we undid
the straps and led him to the stable. I realized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
he was feeling too deeply to listen to my
chatter, so I kept very quiet. When we started
back to the house I told him he must not bother
about me,&mdash;that I had a book and would just
make myself at home out in the summer-house.</p>

<p>"I will come, too," he faltered. "Looks like
I'll go crazy if I have to stay alone."</p>

<p>"Oh, do come! Maybe you would like me to
read to you."</p>

<p>"No, Miss Page! Just let me talk to you.
You see I feel so bad about Ellen because she
ain't been back to see her folks. I didn't know
she wanted to go, but it seems she did and didn't
like to say so. I ought to have known about it.
If I hadn't have been a numskull I would
a-known. I've been so happy just to be with her
that I never thought she wasn't just as happy to
be with me."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Miller, I am sure she was.
Everybody is always saying how happy Mrs.
Miller is. Only the other day I heard Sally
Winn declare she never saw such a contented
young married woman. Sally says lots of young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
married women are not happy; that it takes a
long time for them to get used to husbands instead
of sweethearts; but that your wife didn't
have to do that because you seemed just like a
sweetheart all the time."</p>

<p>"Did she say that,&mdash;did she truly? I wonder
what made her think it."</p>

<p>"Something your wife told her, I reckon!"</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you! Thank you for that! She
could have gone to her mother if I had known
she wanted to."</p>

<p>"Of course she could, but maybe she did want
to go to her mother and didn't want to leave you.
I bet that was the reason she didn't tell you she
wanted to see her mother. She knew you would
insist upon her going, and then she would have
had to leave you."</p>

<p>Now the poor anxious young man was smiling.
He wiped his eyes and grasped my hand.</p>

<p>"You are powerful like Doc Allison, Miss
Page. He knows how to cure a sick spirit just
as well as a sick body, and you sure can comfort
a fellow, too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>There was the creak of a screen door being
hastily opened on the side porch of the farmhouse
and an old colored woman came running out.
Henry Miller jumped to his feet but could not
go to meet her. Fear seemed to grip him. What
news was she bringing?</p>

<p>"Marse Hinry, it's a boy! It's a boy!"</p>

<p>"A boy?"</p>

<p>"Yassir, a boy, an' jes' as peart as kin be, an'
Miss Ellen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is she dead?"</p>

<p>"Daid! Law, chile, she is the livinges' thing
you ever seed an' what's mo' she is a-axin' fer you
jes' lak she can't stan' it a minute longer 'thout
she see you. Baby cryin' fer you, too!" and
sure enough we did hear a faint squeaky cry issuing
from an upstairs room.</p>

<p>The newly-made parent sprinted to the house
as though he were in a Marathon race, and the
old colored woman and I looked at each other
and wiped the tears off that would roll down our
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Young paws allus is kinder pitable," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
remarked, and then hastened back to her
labors.</p>

<p>Father came out soon, his lean face beaming
with smiles, his arm thrown around the shoulders
of the ecstatic Henry. We were to stay to dinner
at the farmhouse, much to the delight of the
old colored cook. It was deemed a great privilege
in the county to have Doc Allison stop for
dinner.</p>

<p>"I done made a dumplin' fer Marse Hinry,"
she said, as we were sitting down to the hospitable
board. "In stressful times men-folks mus'
eat or they gits ter broodin' on they troubles, an'
whin men-folks gits ter broodin' if'n they ain't
full er victuals fo' yer know it they is full er
liquor."</p>

<p>As Henry Miller was a most respectable,
church-going young man this amused Father
very much.</p>

<p>"That's so, Aunt Min, so you feed him up.
He had better look out, anyhow, because before
you know it that young man upstairs will be
whipping him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>This delighted the negress, who chuckled with
glee as she passed the dumplings.</p>

<p>"I is glad it's a boy 'cep'n' they is been so many
boys born here lately that this ol' nigger is beginning
ter s'picion that these here battles I hear
'bout is goin' ter spread this-a-way. In war time
all the gal babies is born boys."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not, Aunt Min," said Father
gravely.</p>

<p>"Yassir! An' the snakes! I never seed the
like of snakes this summer gone by. That means
the debble is busy an' the debble is the father of
war."</p>

<p>"True, true!" sighed the doctor. "Well, I
hope it won't come to us until the youngster upstairs
is able to help defend us."</p>

<p>While we were at dinner, Father was called up
on the Millers' telephone. Mrs. Reed, an old
lady on the adjoining farm, was very ill and the
doctor must leave his dumpling unfinished and
fly to her. The colt was harnessed with the expedition
used in a fire engine house and we were
on our way in an incredibly short time.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MORE THINGS HAPPENING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Reeds were aristocrats of the first rank.
There were no men in the family at all, no one
but old Mrs. Reed, who had been a widow for at
least forty years, and her two old maid daughters,
Miss Elizabeth and Miss Margaret.</p>

<p>Weston was a beautiful place if somewhat
gone to seed by reason of the impossibility of obtaining
the necessary labor to keep it up. The
house was a low rambling building, part brick
and part frame, where rooms had been added on
in days gone by when the family was waxing instead
of waning, as was now the case.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth insisted upon my coming in
the house although I longed to be allowed the
privilege of exploring the garden, which I had
remembered with great pleasure from former
visits with my father. No matter if potatoes had
to go unplanted and wheat uncut, the ladies of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Weston had never permitted the flower garden
to be neglected. I could see it from the window
of the parlor through the half closed blinds.
Cosmos and chrysanthemums were massed in
glowing clumps, holding their own in spite of a
light frost we had had the night before. The
monthly roses, huge bushes that looked as
though they had been there for centuries, were
blooming profusely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reed was very, very low, so low that her
daughters feared the worst. A door opened
from the parlor into her bedroom, which the
daughters spoke of always with a kind of reverence
as "the chamber." Through this door I
could hear the low clear voice of the old lady as
she greeted the doctor.</p>

<p>"How do you do, James? I am glad to see
you once more."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Reed, I am more than glad of the
privilege of seeing you. May I feel your
pulse?" His tone was that of a man who requests
to kiss one's hand.</p>

<p>"You may, James, but there is no use. I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
quite easy now, but only a few moments ago my
heart quite stopped beating. Each time I swing
a little lower. Did I hear someone say you had
little Page with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame! She is in the parlor."</p>

<p>"I want to see the child."</p>

<p>I heard quite distinctly but I did not want to
go in, shrinking instinctively from the ordeal of
speaking to the old lady who was swinging so
low.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth came for me. It seemed impossible
to me that anyone could be older than
Miss Elizabeth, who looked a hundred. She was
in reality almost seventy. The mother was
ninety but did not look any older than the
daughter nor much more fragile. Miss Margaret
was much more buxom than Miss Elizabeth
and perhaps ten years younger. She was
regarded by the two older ladies as nothing more
than a child.</p>

<p>"Mother wants to see you," whispered the
weeping Miss Elizabeth. Miss Elizabeth always
did weep about everything. In fact, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
course of her threescore years and almost ten, so
many tears had flowed down her cheeks that they
had worn a little furrow from the corner of her
eye to the corner of her mouth, where it made a
neat little twist outward just in time to keep the
salt water out of her mouth. These wrinkles in
the poor lady's cheeks gave to her countenance
a whimsical expression of laughter. The little
twist at the end of the furrow was responsible for
this.</p>

<p>I went as bidden and hoped no one knew how
I hated it.</p>

<p>"Page, Mrs. Reed wants to see you a moment,"
said Father very gently.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" I whispered in such a wee
voice that I felt as though someone away off had
said it and not I. I knew that Mrs. Reed was
deaf, too, and that I should have spoken in a loud
tone.</p>

<p>"I'll be better soon, child," answered the old
lady, who did not seem to be deaf at all. They
say sometimes just before death that faculties become
quite acute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"How pretty you are, my dear, almost as
pretty as your mother. I hope you appreciate
what a good man your father is." Her voice was
very low and I had to lean over to catch what she
was saying. Her thin old hands were lying on
the outside of the counterpane and they seemed
to me to look already dead. I had never seen a
dead person but I fancied that their hands must
look just that way. I was deeply grateful to
Fate that I did not have to take one of those
hands.</p>

<p>"Yes; ma'am&mdash;I&mdash;believe I do. He is the best
man in the world."</p>

<p>"He is so honest. Now he knows I am almost
gone and he would not tell me a lie about it for
anything,&mdash;would you, James?"</p>

<p>"No, madame!" and Father put his finger
again on her wrist. Miss Elizabeth wept silently
and Miss Margaret sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>"Tell me, has Ellen Miller's baby come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have just come from there. It is a
fine boy and mother and baby doing well."</p>

<p>"Good! I am glad when I hear some men are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
being born into the county. Too many women!
Too many women! What are you girls crying
for?" she asked, turning her head a little on the
pillow and looking with wonder at the two old
ladies she called girls. "There is no use in crying
for me. I am glad to die,&mdash;not that I have
not been happy in my life,&mdash;yes, very happy!
But there are more on the other side than this
side now for me. Your father and brothers, my
father and mother and brothers and sisters, all
my friends. Do you think I'll know them,
James?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame, I think you will."</p>

<p>"I don't expect them to know me," the faint
old voice went on. "How could they know me,
so old and wrinkled and feeble? My husband
was only fifty-five when he died and I was still
nothing more than a child of fifty. My hair had
not turned and I was very lively. Do you think
he will be disappointed to find me so old?"</p>

<p>Her mind was wandering now and her voice
trailed off to the finest thread. Father motioned
me to go, but before I could turn the old lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
suddenly sat up in bed and called to her daughters:</p>

<p>"Don't forget to have the giant-of-battle rose
trimmed back and those hollyhocks transplanted!"
Then she fell back on her pillow and
closed her eyes.</p>

<p>I slipped out of the room and ran into the
garden where Father found me a half hour
later.</p>

<p>"How is Mrs. Reed, Father?" I asked. He
looked at me wonderingly.</p>

<p>"She is well again," he answered gently.
"She was dead, my dear, before you left the
room."</p>

<p>"Oh, Father!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"I was sorry for you to be there, but I got
fooled. I thought the old lady was going to live
a few hours longer, but doctors know mighty little
when you come down to life and death. Come,
honey! We must go. I have a sick child to see
on my way home."</p>

<p>We had to stop at a little country store on the
way to see the sick child to get some chewing-gum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
for the youthful patient. Father always
had chewing-gum for the sick kiddies and that
kept him in high favor with them. Doc Allison
was looked upon as a kind of concrete Santy who
gave un-Christmas presents. He carried peppermints
always in his pocket, and when a child
was told to poke out his tongue he more than
likely would find a peppermint on it before he
pulled it in again.</p>

<p>The child was better and our stay did not have
to be very lengthy. All the children in the family
had insisted upon showing their tongues to the
giver of peppermints, which delayed us a few
moments.</p>

<p>"And now for home!" said Father, who was
looking tired. He actually handed the reins to
me to drive while he filled his pipe for a peaceful
smoke.</p>

<p>We were passing through a settlement where
there was the usual post-office, country store,
church and schoolhouse, with a few houses
straggling around, when a young man ran out
into the road and called desperately to Father to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
stop. I drew rein and he came panting to the
buggy.</p>

<p>"Doc Allison, please come be witness for us!"</p>

<p>"Witness? What for?"</p>

<p>"Well, Julia and I have walked off to get
married. I won't say 'run off' because both of
us are of age and have been of age for a good
five years. But Julia's mother is that cantankerous
that she won't let her get married if she
knows about it, and so we have come to the parson's
with license and all; but he says we must
have witnesses and there's no one in the settlement
right now but the postmaster and the
storekeeper and they can't leave their jobs, and
besides they are afraid of the old lady. She is
on her way here now, I believe, so you'll have to
hurry."</p>

<p>We found the bride in the parson's parlor
looking nervously out of the window. She, too,
was afraid of the old lady. I was sorry for the
parson because he must have been afraid, too, but
he went manfully through the ceremony. He
had hardly finished with: "Whom God hath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
united let no man put asunder," when there was a
terrible commotion in the road. An old lady
came driving up in a spring wagon. She had
blood in her eye, a terribly rampagious old lady.
She stepped out of the wagon and I noticed she
had on top boots. She wore a short, scant skirt
and a workman's blue chambray shirt and a
man's hat pulled down over as determined a
countenance as I have ever seen.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Henderson!" gasped the preacher,
turning pale, and well he might as Mrs. Henderson
was someone to stand in awe of.</p>

<p>"Come on home here, girl!" she said roughly,
as she made her way into the parson's parlor.</p>

<p>"Her home is where I live now," said
the young man, putting his arm around the
bride.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I never got too late to anything
in my life. I telephoned these folks over here
that they had better not stand as witness to any
ceremony until I got here, and I know they
wouldn't do it." She had been too enraged to
notice Father and me, but now when Father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
stepped up and spoke to her, she fell back in
confusion.</p>

<p>"My daughter and I were fortunately in time
to witness the ceremony," he said quietly. "It
is all over now and your daughter is safely married."</p>

<p>"Married!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Henderson, and I advise you to
sit still a moment and compose yourself. You
will have apoplexy some of these days flying off
in these rages." He looked at her very sternly.
"Your daughter has married a good young fellow
and she will be much happier than she would
be remaining single."</p>

<p>"What business is it of yours, I'd like to
know?"</p>

<p>"No business at all, except that I was asked to
witness the ceremony by your son-in-law; and if
you should get sick from the excitement you are
working yourself into, you will send for me post
haste," answered Father coolly.</p>

<p>"Never! Not after the bad turn you have
done me!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that's as you choose," he laughed.</p>

<p>Then he kissed the bride, who had said never a
word but clung to her husband; shook hands
with the groom and the parson; held out his hand
to the irate, booted old woman. She would <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits this word">have</ins> none
of him, however, but folded her arms and sniffed
indignantly. She made me think of:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"But Douglas 'round him drew his cloak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Folded his arms and thus he spoke:"</span><br />
</div>

<p>One couldn't help laughing at her but feeling
sorry for her, too.</p>

<p>"She'll have to pay for this," said Father, as
we started again for home. "She has been going
into rages like this all her life and usually has
a spell of sickness after one like to-day's."</p>

<p>"But, Father, you surely would not go to her
after the way she spoke to you!"</p>

<p>"Of course I would if she needs me. Country
doctors can't be too touchy. It isn't as though
she could get someone else as she could in town.
In cities a doctor isn't so important as he is in
the country. There are always plenty more to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
answer a call that he turns down. I have never
in my life refused a patient."</p>

<p>We had a quiet drive home, Father smoking
his pipe, while I gave undivided attention to the
prancings and shyings of the colt. I was thinking
of all the happenings of the day.</p>

<p>"A penny for your thoughts!" he said, pinching
my ear. "I bet I know what you are ruminating."</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"You have come to the conclusion that a good
deal can happen in a country neighborhood in a
day: a birth, a death, a marriage and a quarrel."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE END OF AN EVENTFUL DAY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Things</span> kept on happening. When I got out
of the buggy to open the big gate leading into
the avenue, a gate that was supposed to work by
pulling a string but which never did, I saw some
peculiar tracks in the dust of the road.</p>

<p>"An automobile has gone in," I exclaimed,
"and hasn't gone out, either! Look, the tracks
don't come back!"</p>

<p>"Heavens! I do hope I am not to go out
again," said Father wearily. "I'd like to sit on
the back of my neck in my sleepy-hollow chair
and talk or listen as the case might be. I am too
tired even to read."</p>

<p>"Me, too! And hungry's not the word!"</p>

<p>"A midday dinner gets mighty far off by supper
time. I hope Susan realizes that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>A dusty Ford car was drawn up near the stile
block. It looked familiar, but then all Fords
have a way of looking that.</p>

<p>"Who on earth can it be? Well, if I have to
go out again at least you and the colt won't,"
sighed the poor country doctor. "I am going
to make the owner of that car carry me wherever
I am to go and what's more bring me back. I
am not going to sit on the front seat with him,
either, and listen to his jabber. Me for the rear
and a whole seat to myself. I might even get a
nap."</p>

<p>A sudden opening of the front door and who
should come tearing out but Dum and Dee
Tucker and Zebedee? Of course the lines of the
dusty car were familiar: Henry Ford himself,
faithful servitor!</p>

<p>The tired feeling vanished very quickly in our
joy at the disclosure of the owner of the car.
Father was always glad to see the Tuckers but
was doubly glad now, because it being the Tuckers,
meant it was not someone to snatch him
away from his sleepy-hollow chair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>At Mammy Susan's instigation the twins were
already installed in my room. There were plenty
of guest chambers at Bracken, but we always
liked to be in the same room. Whenever we had
tried sleeping in separate rooms we felt we had
missed something.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" I cried, hugging the
twins again as we hastened to my room to make
ourselves fit for the supper that Mammy Susan
warned us she was a-dishin' up.</p>

<p>"Well, we are having a Tucker discussion and
we thought you and Dr. Allison should be called
in consultation, especially as you are one of the
parties concerned," answered Dum.</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you! We'd like to know what plan we
could make where you were not concerned," put
in Dee.</p>

<p>"Please tell me what it is!"</p>

<p>"Wait until after supper, and when the men-folks
light their pipes, then we can talk it out.
You can do twice as much with Zebedee when he
is fed," said the knowing Dee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father, too, is more amenable to reason," I
laughed.</p>

<p>Mammy Susan had fully realized that a midday
dinner is a long way from supper and had
planned a royal feast for us, and when the Tuckers
arrived she added to her menu to suit their
tastes and appetites. Mammy Susan always remembered
what guests liked best, and no matter
how much trouble it was to her, usually managed
to have that particular dish. The Tuckers were
prime favorites with the dear old woman and she
could not do enough for them.</p>

<p>Supper over, we adjourned to the library
where a cheery wood fire was crackling in the
great fireplace. There was frost in the air and a
fire was quite acceptable, although we had the
windows wide open. Father and I loved to make
up a big fire and then have plenty of cold fresh
air.</p>

<p>"I can't see the use er heatin' up the whole er
Bracken, but if Docallison is a-willin' ter pay
fer cuttin' the wood, 'tain't fer me ter 'jec'," said
Mammy Susan as she peeped in to see that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
was plenty of wood, hoping in her secret soul
that there would not be so she could have some
excuse for quarreling with the yard boy.
Mammy Susan waged an eternal warfare with
the yard boy, whoever he might be. We had so
many it was hard to keep up with their changing
names, so Father called them all George.</p>

<p>It was dear Mammy's one failing. She simply
could not live in peace with other servants. We
had long ago given up trying to have a housemaid,
as Mammy Susan would have complained
of the lack of efficiency of a graduate of a domestic
science school of the first standing. No
one could help her cook. Mrs. Rorer herself
would have been found wanting in the culinary
department of Bracken.</p>

<p>"Humph! Wood enough fer onct!" she
grumbled. "If'n I hadn' er got right behin'
that there so-called George there wouldn' er been.
He is the triflinges' nigger," she mumbled, as she
went through the hall. Zebedee ran after her
and her grumblings were changed to chucklings
by something that passed between them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor old Susan!" said Father, as he sank
into the deepest hollow of his chair. "She is so
capable herself that she expects all of her race to
toe the mark, too. She is very lenient with the
white people whom she loves and absolutely
adamantine with the coloreds. The white folks
can do no wrong and the black folks can do no
right."</p>

<p>Pipes were filled for the two parents and a box
of candy opened for the daughters, and then we
were ready for the business of the day to be discussed.</p>

<p>"Dr. Allison, what are you going to do with
Page this winter?" asked Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>"Do with Page! Why&mdash;nothing but&mdash;nothing
at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, doctor&mdash;&mdash;" broke in Dum and in
the same breath Dee clamored:</p>

<p>"We want&mdash;&mdash;" but nobody heard what we
wanted as I had to put in my oar saying I
thought I ought to stay at home.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, if we all of us talk at once
we won't get anywhere, and we might just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
well have stayed in Richmond," complained
Zebedee.</p>

<p>"Well, let's appoint a chairman then," I suggested,
"and everybody address the chair. I
nominate Mr. Tucker chairman pro tem."</p>

<p>He was duly elected.</p>

<p>"Nominations are in order for chairman," and
the chairman pro tem rapped for order.</p>

<p>"I nominate Mr. Tucker for chairman," said
Father contentedly from his easy chair.</p>

<p>"I second the nomination," from me.</p>

<p>"I nominate Dr. Allison!" cried Dum.</p>

<p>"Second the nomination!" said Dee, jumping
to her feet for a speech. "Zebedee is too Mr.
Tuckerish when he gets in the chair to suit me,
and besides he will have to be talking too much in
this meeting to occupy the chair with any grace."</p>

<p>"I withdraw my name as candidate," said the
first nominee graciously. "Any other nominations?
The chair hears none,&mdash;then it is in order
to make the election of Dr. Allison unanimous."
It was done so with three rousing cheers.</p>

<p>Father always enjoyed the Tuckers' foolishness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and he was now in a state of relaxation and
contentment, after a strenuous day spent in doing
his duty, that fitted in well with our cheerful
guests.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to have the chair if I can sit
in it," he said. "Friends, since there are no
minutes, we can dispense with the reading of
them. What is the business of the day?"</p>

<p>"Mr. President, what are we going to do with
our daughters this coming winter?" said Zebedee,
rising to his feet and speaking after due acknowledgment
from the chair. "'The time has
come' the walrus said, 'to talk of many things,'
but this business of occupying these girls, whom
a Merciful Providence has confided to our care,
is a serious matter. They are too young to stop
school altogether, especially since they don't
want to make d&eacute;buts&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who said we didn't? We'd do anything
rather than go back to school," interrupted Dum.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tucker has the floor," said Father with
mock severity.</p>

<p>"I rise to a question of privilege," announced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Dee solemnly. "We are 'most as old as Zebedee
was when he got married and quite as old as our
mother was." At this Zebedee laughed a little
and wiped his eyes once. He always had a tear
ready for his young wife who was spared to him
such a little while.</p>

<p>"Well, honey, even if you are, times have
changed. Young folks don't stop school as soon
as they used to."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you he would get Mr. Tuckerish?
Just listen to him! Talking about young
folks as though he were a million."</p>

<p>"Address the chair!" and Father rapped for
order.</p>

<p>"May I ask your indulgence for a moment,
Mr. President?" asked Zebedee meekly. "As I
was saying, when the gentleman from nowhere
interrupted me: our daughters are too young to
stop studying altogether. Don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"If you will allow the chair to express an
opinion, I am afraid they are."</p>

<p>"Of course Gresham's burning down was most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
inopportune, as they would have been safely
placed for another year there, but now that it is
burned and not rebuilt yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We wouldn't go back there, anyhow, with
that old Miss Plympton bossing things," asserted
Dum.</p>

<p>"Now what I want to find is some way to have
them go on studying and learning and still not be
bored to death," and Zebedee sat down.</p>

<p>"A Daniel come to judgment!" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Are you addressing the chair?" asked Father.</p>

<p>"No, I was just talking to myself."</p>

<p>"Of course, I want to study art more than
anything in the world!" exclaimed Dum, bouncing
on her feet and forcing an acknowledgment
from the chair before Dee had time to get it. "I
can't see the use in burdening myself with Latin
and math when I am nearly dead to model
things."</p>

<p>"Well, you haven't overburdened yourself
with knowledge yet, I am glad to say," teased
her father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you addressing the chair?" asked our
president sternly. "If not, pray do so."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. President, I want to study physiology
and anatomy," said Dee. "And for the
life of me I can't see what good ancient history
and French would do me."</p>

<p>"And I want to be a writer, and it seems to
me the best way to be one is&mdash;just to be one," I
remarked.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" smiled Father.</p>

<p>"And now we want to talk over what is the
best way for these girls to get what they want and
still not be idle," said Mr. Tucker. "I should
like to hear what our honored president has to
say."</p>

<p>"Well, friends, this has kind of been sprung
on me. I have been living in a kind of fool's
paradise, thinking that maybe our girls knew
enough to stop; but I see that I was wrong.
Girls never know enough to stop. I'll let my
third do whatever you let your two-thirds do, if
it isn't too wild."</p>

<p>"But, Father, I am going to stay right here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
at Bracken with you! You know you need
me."</p>

<p>"Of course I need you, but you don't think
I need you any more than Tucker needs his
daughters. You will settle down soon enough
and now is the time to gather material for writing.
Things make an impression on you now
that wouldn't when you are older. One can put
off writing longer than getting experience," and
Father drew me down on the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>"Where do you think these monkeys should go
to get these varied industries they are longing
for, Tucker?"</p>

<p>"New York, I should say."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PLANS FOR THE FUTURE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">New York!</span> The very sound of the name
thrilled me. It was all I could do to keep from
following the twins in their demonstration of joy
and gratitude lavished on their father. I contented
myself, however, by rumpling up my father's
hair.</p>

<p>"When?" gasped Father, when I had finished
with him.</p>

<p>"Immediately if not sooner!" said Zebedee,
coming out unscathed from the embraces of his
girls. "I have been thinking a lot about it and
I really believe it would be the best thing for
them. They can in a way find themselves, and
they don't get in any more scrapes without us
than they do with us."</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed Father.</p>

<p>"Oh, we won't get in any scrapes at all!" declared
Dee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a single one, if you only trust us!"
maintained Dum.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to take my oath upon it that
you won't get into some, but if you talk over
anything you are contemplating, in the way of
adventure, with wise little Page, I don't believe
your scrapes will amount to much."</p>

<p>Zebedee always complimented me by insisting
that my judgment was good, and for a wonder,
the girls did not mind when he praised me. They
were very jealous of their father's praise when
it was laid on too thickly, except where I was
concerned, but they agreed with him heartily
when he lauded me to the skies.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't say that," I said, blushing.
"I might prove myself unworthy of the trust
imposed in me,&mdash;and then what?"</p>

<p>"Then I shall have to declare myself at fault
in character reading."</p>

<p>"But, Page, you know you always hold us
down! When we get into trouble it is against
your judgment. If we listen to you, we keep
straight," said Dum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean I preach!"</p>

<p>"That's the funny thing about you, Page: you
give us sage, grown-up advice without preaching.
We wouldn't listen a minute if you preached."</p>

<p>"All right, I promise never to do that objectionable
thing," I laughed. "But really and
truly, I don't think Father ought to afford this
trip for me."</p>

<p>"Child, it's not a trip," and Father put his
arm around me again. "It's part of your education.
New York need not be such an expensive
place if you girls go there with economical
ideas in your heads, instead of extravagant ones."</p>

<p>"Certainly! We had better allowance them
and that will be part of their training, as well as
what they will get from the several schools. My
girls know very little about finances and it is
high time they learned. Experience is the only
way for them to learn, as whenever I try to instill
in them principles of economy they say I
am Mr. Tuckerish," and Zebedee tried to look
stern.</p>

<p>The idea of his instilling principles of economy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
in anybody's mind was so funny all of us had to
laugh. One thing Mr. Tucker insisted on was
not spending money until you had it; but the
minute you did have it, what was it meant for but
to spend? "Easy come, easy go!" was the motto
for the whole Tucker family.</p>

<p>"Oh, we will live so cheap I haven't a doubt
we'll save oodlums of money!" cried Dum.
"Mrs. Edwin Green told me a lot about how
cheap one can live in Bohemia. She told us
whenever we went to New York she was going to
give us a letter of introduction to her brother and
sister-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Kent Brown."</p>

<p>Mrs. Edwin Green was the lovely young
woman we had met in Charleston when we took
our famous trip down there. She was a Miss
Molly Brown of Kentucky who had married
Professor Edwin Green of Wellington College.
They were the very nicest couple I ever
knew and we became great friends with
them. We corresponded with her and a letter
from "Molly Brown" was highly prized by all
of us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and she said we were to visit her at
Wellington if we got anywhere near. Won't it
be great?" and Dee danced around the library
from pure glee.</p>

<p>"How will we live in New York?" I asked.
"Shall we board or what?"</p>

<p>"Board, by all means! If you try to live any
other way you will run into debt, I am afraid,"
said Zebedee.</p>

<p>"But we just naturally despise boarding,"
pouted Dum. "We've been boarding all our
lives, it seems to me."</p>

<p>"But when you board, you are in a measure
chaperoned," said her cautious parent.</p>

<p>"Chaperoned! Oh, Zebedee, you make me
laugh. What boarding-house keeper has time to
chaperone? Besides, isn't Page along to chaperone?"</p>

<p>"What do you think about it, Page? Come
along now with that sage advice," teased Father.</p>

<p>"I have never boarded and don't know how
I'd like it, but it seems to me the best thing for
us to do would be to board when we first get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
there, and then if we can't stand it, take a little
flat and keep house, or rather, flat."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see why your advice is so sought after
by our worthy friends, the Tuckers; you are as
wise as Solomon and cut the baby in two and
satisfy all parties. You will go to boarding to
suit Tucker and then get a flat to suit the daughters,
eh, honey?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-fifty is a safe course to pursue, and
safety first is best and wisest for an official umpire,"
I maintained.</p>

<p>"I must say that the oracle has spoken well,"
said Zebedee. "Of course, if they are not happy
boarding they must not keep to it, but it is better
for them to start that way. They can learn the
ropes and decide later on to get a flat if it seems
wiser. We can go on with them and establish
them, eh, doctor?"</p>

<p>"I reckon so, if my patients behave. Now
that old Mrs. Reed is dead, I can leave perhaps&mdash;Ellen
Miller's baby safely here, too!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Father, that will be simply grand, if you
can only go!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't had a trip for a long, long time,
and I think it is up to me to treat myself."</p>

<p>All of us thought so, too. It made it easier
for me if Father was contemplating going with
us for a little recreation. He worked so hard,
had so little fun in his life. What fun there was
he made for himself by treating life as something
very amusing when all was told. His patience
was only equalled by his sense of humor.</p>

<p>"Don't give out that you are going on a trip,
Father, and then all of your cranky patients
won't have time to trump up any illnesses. If
Sally Winn hears of your intended departure,
she will get up seven fits of heart failure and
more fluterations and smotherines than enough
to keep you at home."</p>

<p>"Poor Sally! I wish she could go on a trip
herself. It would do more towards curing her
than all the pink, pump water in the world."</p>

<p>Sally Winn was Father's hypochondriacal patient
who called him up at all hours of the day
and night for an imaginary heart trouble that
was supposed to be carrying her off. She did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
feel safe with Father out of the county and never
let him get away if she could help it.</p>

<p>"Why don't you suggest it to her? She
might come on and visit her cousin, Reginald
Kent."</p>

<p>"Reginald Kent! By Jove, I forgot that fellow
when I proposed New York as a good place
for you girls to top off your very incomplete education,"
and Zebedee groaned.</p>

<p>"Well, what is the matter with Reginald
Kent?" bridled Dum.</p>

<p>"Matter! Nothing's the matter, that's what's
the matter. See here, Dum Tucker, if you go to
New York and fall in love with that good-looking,
clever young man I'll kill myself," declared
the desperate Zebedee, always afraid that some
man would come along and cut him out with his
girls.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Zebedeedlums! Reginald Kent
will have to fall in love with me before I fall in
love with him."</p>

<p>"Well, if that's so, I'll fix him! I'll tell him
what a bad proposition you are: mean, ungenerous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
deceitful, secretive. I'll put him on to you."
As these were all the things Dum was not, we felt
safe.</p>

<p>"Shan't we let Mary Flannagan know our
plans? She may want to join us there," suggested
Dee.</p>

<p>"Of course we want dear old Mary," Dum
and I cried together.</p>

<p>We all of us thought with regret of what a
winter like the one we were planning to have
would have meant to Annie Pore.</p>

<p>Mary was a great favorite with both Father
and Mr. Tucker, so they readily consented to our
writing to her, suggesting that she should join
us in New York if her mother thought well of the
plan.</p>

<p>"She can go on with her movie stunts, and
take up dancing and gym work in real earnest
under the right instructors," said Dee.</p>

<p>"I hope she won't try to climb down any walls
in New York," I laughed. "We mustn't get in
a flat with ivy on the walls."</p>

<p>"Oh, so it is to be a flat, is it? I understood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
you were to board first," said Zebedee, pretending
to be insulted.</p>

<p>"So we are, but of course we will end up in a
flat, and I fancy Mary will stand in awe of the
boarding-house keeper enough to keep her from
scaling her walls."</p>

<p>Our whole evening was spent in talking over
our plans for topping off our education in New
York. Father and Zebedee were like two boys
in the suggestions they made. They had perfect
faith in us, knowing that we had sense enough to
bring us safely through the experience. I have
wondered since if our mothers had been alive if
they would have consented to the plan, but, of
course, if our mothers had been alive, our education
would not have been quite so loose-jointed.
Mothers are much more particular than fathers
about their daughters' education.</p>

</div>
<p>To be sure, Mrs. Flannagan did consent to
Mary's going, but then she was rather a haphazard
lady herself, looking upon life with a
humorous twinkle in her Irish eye. She believed
heartily in the doctrine of live and let live, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
forsooth, if Mary had mapped out for herself a
career as a movie actress, why let her work it out!
She, her mother, was certainly not going to block
her game.</p>

<p>Mammy Susan was the one who kicked up
about my going. For once she and Cousin Park
Garnett were of the same mind. Cousin Park
almost got out an injunction on Father to restrain
him as one who was not in his right mind.
A lunacy commission would have had him locked
up in the State Asylum, according to that irate
dame.</p>

<p>She never would have known about my going
if she had not chosen to make a visitation at
Bracken just when I was in the throes of getting
ready to spend the winter in New York. Her
own house was having some repairs, so she had
made a convenience of our hospitality to escape
the discomforts of paperhangers and painters. I
was afraid at first that she would stay so long
Father could not get away, but a lawsuit she was
engaged in came to court and she was forced to
cut her untimely visit short. I found out afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
that the case, which was a trifling matter
of back-yard fences, was put up first on the
docket by some adroit wire-pulling done by no
less a person than Mr. Jeffry Tucker, the ever
ready. It was done so silently that Cousin Park
never found it out. She was forced to return to
her dismantled house, much to the regret of the
workmen who were revelling in the absence of an
exacting housekeeper.</p>

<p>Mammy Susan, however, had her say out in
regard to my going away from home: "I's
gonter speak my min' if'n it's the las' ac' er my
life. Gals ain't called on ter be a-trapsin' all the
time. Mammy's baby ain't never gonter be content
at Bracken no mo'. Always a-goin' an'
never a-comin'. An' me'n Docallison so lonesome,
too. I wisht you was twins&mdash;I 'low I'd
keep one er you at home."</p>

<p>"Which one, Mammy Susan?"</p>

<p>"T'other one!"</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LETTER FROM ANNIE PORE TO PAGE ALLISON</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;"><i>Grantley Grange,</i></span><br />
<i>Grantley, England.</i><br />
</div>

<span class="smcap">My dearest Page:</span>

<p>It takes such an interminable time to get
mail in these war times that I am afraid my letter
will seem like last year's almanac by the time it
reaches you. I must begin at the beginning and
tell you of our journey across the ocean, but before
I plunge into the lengthy recital I must inform
you that I am very happy in my new home.
I could not be anything but happy when I realize
how much better off poor Father is. Of course
the family is in the deepest mourning because of
the death of Uncle Isaac and my cousin Grant,
and there is an air of sadness in the whole village
of Grantley; but everybody is very kind to us
and I am sure I shall soon grow to love my aunts,
the Misses Grace and Muriel Pore. These ladies
are older than my father but they are quite
strong and robust and it is wonderful what they
can accomplish in the way of work.</p>

<p>All the women of England are busy at one
thing or another. Women, great ladies who have
never done any form of work before, not even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
dressed their own hair, are washing dishes in hospitals
or doing other menial tasks.</p>

<p>Uncle Isaac was a widower, so the aunts have
had entire charge of the housekeeping at Grantley
Grange for many years. I think they are
very kind to me in not looking upon me as an
interloper.</p>

<p>Aunt Grace tells me that their father, my
grandfather, bitterly regretted his sternness towards
my father and mother and was willing at
any time to make amends, but my father would
never answer his letters. Poor Father is so sensitive.
That has always been his trouble. I live
in constant terror now for fear someone will hurt
his feelings and he will refuse to see people or
make himself miserable. He is to make himself
useful and serve his country by teaching the boys
in a school at Grantley. All of the young teachers
have gone to the front and the nation needs
teachers for the boys and girls. I am so happy
that Father is to serve his country, somehow, and
this is, after all, a very noble service as it is for
the future good of the British Empire.</p>

<p>I know you wonder what I am going to do. I
was willing to nurse if my aunts thought it wise,
but was relieved when they decided that I could
be of more use doing other things that life has
already trained me to do. I know I should fail
at the crucial moment as a nurse. I am so timid
and do not seem to be able to shake off this shyness.
It has been decided that I shall go every
day to sing to the soldiers in the neighboring hospitals.
That sounds like very little to do but
when I tell you that I spend on an average of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
seven hours a day going to the various hospitals,
you will realize that while it is very little to do, it
takes a great deal of time to do it.</p>

<p>So many of the old estates near here have been
turned over to the Government for hospitals that
one can motor from one to the other in a short
time. The wounded soldiers are very kind to me
and express themselves as liking very much to
hear me sing. They like the American songs,
especially the darky songs. I sang "Clar de
Kitchen" to them yesterday and they made me
give them three encores. I thought of the last
time I sang it when we had the circus at Maxton,
and I choked with emotion at the remembrance
of all of my dear friends.</p>

<p>Life at Price's Landing seems very far off and
unreal, although there are times when this life
seems to be the unreal thing and I expect any
moment to awaken and find it all a dream. I remember
in my little room over the store how low
the ceiling was, so low over my bed where it
sloped to the dormer window that I could lie
there and touch it with my hand, and many a
time have I bumped my head when I sprang too
hurriedly from my bed. I learned to put up my
hand and gauge the distance before I got up, in
that way saving my poor head many a bump.
I find myself now, when morning comes and the
sun peeps in the windows of my great bedroom,
reaching up expecting to touch the low ceiling of
my little room in Virginia. It gives me a strange
sensation, almost as great a shock as when you
take one more step up when you have reached the
top of the stairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The ceilings at Grantley Grange are quite as
high as any I have ever seen. Too high for
beauty, I think, but I don't dare say so. My
aunts think perhaps there are more wonderfully
beautiful places than the Grange, but they have
never seen them,&mdash;except the great show places,
of course. It is very beautiful and the time may
come when I shall feel at home, but I still feel
strange and something of an alien.</p>

<p>Father is as at home as though he had never
left England. I wish all of you could see poor
Father in his proper surroundings. He always
was so out of place in the store. I think he felt
irritated all the time that he was doing what he
was doing, but a certain obstinacy in his character
kept him from seeking more congenial employment.
His sisters are very tender with him
and I am hoping that he will begin to show to
them the affection that I am sure he feels.</p>

<p>Now haven't I put the cart before the horse?
I intended first to tell you all about our voyage
over, and then lead up to conditions here, but I
have left the first to the last.</p>

<p>In the first place poor Father was dreadfully
seasick from the moment we got on the steamer,
even before we started. There is something
about the smell of machinery and rigging that
makes him very ill. I tried to persuade him to
stay on deck, but he would go to his stateroom,
and there he stayed for the entire crossing.</p>

<p>I was anxious to see the last of my country.
(I realize now that United States is my country.
I realized it the moment I knew I was to live in
England.) I stayed on deck as we steamed out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of the harbor and kissed my hand good-by to
New York's sky line and the Statue of Liberty.
I felt very lonesome and very far away from all
of my dear friends. There were letters down in
my stateroom and I turned to go get them, when
whom should I find at my side but George Massie?
Page, I was never more astonished in all
my life! I was glad, too, very glad. All the
lonesome feeling left me. He told me that you
and the Tuckers knew all about his coming and
approved, so that was enough for me. The ocean
did not seem near so vast nor the sky so high
up.</p>

<p>Father was very miserable, so miserable that I
had to call in the ship's surgeon. The doctor
made light of his malady but that did not make
it any easier to bear. I had to nurse him a great
deal, and as he shared his stateroom with another
man it was rather embarrassing for me to go in
at night and attend to poor Father's many wants.
In fact, the man objected.</p>

<p>Then it was I decided to tell Father of George
Massie's presence on board. Of course, he had
no way to know my friend was there. He was
very angry at first, but I had sudden courage and
told him that we had not chartered the ship and
other passengers had as much right there as we
had, and that Mr. Massie was going abroad to
serve the Allies. I also told him that George
was willing to do anything for him he could, and
would attend to him during the night when I
could not come in his stateroom. Father became
reconciled to George's presence then, and he
could hardly have kept up his anger after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
faithful way in which he nursed him for the rest
of the journey.</p>

<p>Of course, he did not have to be nursed all the
time and we had much time on deck. The
weather was perfect and I was not ill one moment.
I had a seat at the captain's table and
that dear old man saw to it that I was bountifully
served. He was so kind to me, and to everyone
in fact, but he seemed to think I needed especial
care and my own father could not have been more
attentive to me.</p>

<p>I know that the news of our boat having struck
a mine must have been a great shock to all of my
friends. I am sure that George's cablegram that
all was well must have set your minds at rest,
however.</p>

<p>It happened just at dusk after a wonderfully
calm day. The sea had been like a mill-pond all
day and the sun very hot, so hot that we had
sought the shade of the boats on deck. Towards
sunset the wind had suddenly risen and the waves
had begun to look very high. Of course all
waves look high to me, as I am fully aware that
I am the most timid person in all the world. It
turned quite cold, so cold that I put on my heavy
coat. We were almost at the end of our journey.
I had everything packed and in order; and
at last we had persuaded Father to dress and
come on deck. He had been much better for
days and had been able to retain nourishment,
which meant a return of his normal strength.
He had even ventured down to dinner on that
evening.</p>

<p>We had hoped to arrive in Liverpool by eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
o'clock but we were proceeding very slowly and
cautiously as the danger zone was filled with possible
disaster. The captain assured us that we
would land sometime during the night but he advised
all of us to go to bed at the usual hour.
Our voyage had been a very pleasant one. I
had made many friends and was glad to feel that
I had been able to throw off some of the miserable
shyness that has always been such a handicap
to me.</p>

<p>For several days we had been wearing life-preservers
by command of the captain. Of
course we felt confident that there was no use in
it, but still we had to do it. George was too big
for any of those furnished by the ship's company,
the straps refusing to meet; but I had pieced out
the straps with some stout cotton cloth.</p>

<p>We were at dinner on that eventful day, all of
us looking very strange and bulky in our safety-first
garb, when suddenly there was an explosion
that shook all of us out of our seats. I was
dreadfully frightened but managed to appear
calm for Father's sake, who because of his recent
illness was much unnerved.</p>

<p>"Get your warm coats and any small hand
baggage with your valuables!" the captain
shouted, "and report on deck immediately."</p>

<p>I tell you we obeyed without any demur!
Many of the passengers hurried up, not going to
their staterooms at all, but Father felt he must
get his Gladstone bag and I had a small satchel
all packed, which I took. I never heard so much
shouting in all my life. The women were
screaming and the men shouting. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
only one child on board, a dear little girl of seven,
and she and I were the calmest ones among the
females. I was frightened at first but a sudden
courage came to me. It may have been because
the little girl slipped her hand in mine. Her
mother had fainted and her husband was carrying
her up on deck. The child's name was Winnie.
She was a gentle little thing. We had
made friends the very first day on board and had
had many long talks together. Her mother was
ill most of the time and Winnie and I had time to
become very intimate. When she slipped her
hand in mine, I knew that she expected me to
look after her, and then it was God sent me
strength to do it.</p>

<p>The engines stopped the moment we hit the
mine and the boat was listing so that when we got
on deck we found a decided slant, so much so that
it was difficult to walk. The life-boats were being
loaded and launched. I was shocked to see
how some of the men crowded in. The sailors
were a rude lot from all the quarters of the globe,
and few of them showed any desire to save anything
but their own skins.</p>

<p>George Massie was everywhere. I was astounded
at his powers of swearing, but he said
afterwards that it was the only way to control
people in times like that. He simply took command
of the boats, for which the captain had no
time. The officers were a rather weak lot and
one and all concerned for their own safety.
They say so many of the good seamen have enlisted
that many of the passenger ships are
manned by weaklings. The captain was splendid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and did his duty like the English gentleman
he was.</p>

<p>Of course at first we feared it was a submarine
that had hit us. Its being a mine that we had hit
made us much more comfortable. At least, we
were not to fall into the hands of the Germans.</p>

<p>"The ship is sinking so slowly that I can assure
you there is no immediate danger," George
had had time to tell Father and me. "It is safe
to wait for the last boat, so let me help launch
these others first and then I can get into the boat
with you. These sailors are too crazy to trust
without a commander."</p>

<p>The captain had determined not to leave the
ship until he was sure there was no chance of
saving it. The chief engineer was to stay with
him and several sailors volunteered. It so happened
that they were able to get into port on
their own steam and we might have stayed safely
on board, but of course the chances were that she
would sink and it was deemed wiser for us to take
to the boats.</p>

<p>I wish all of you might have seen Father. He
was very calm and brave after the first shock was
over. He was not strong enough to help much
but he was willing to help, and when the men
crowded into the boats leaving women shrieking
for places, he swore with almost as much fervor
as George Massie himself. Do you know, Page,
I know it sounds silly, but I believe I love my
father more and am closer to him since I know he
can swear a little? He swore to some purpose,
too, as he called the selfish men such terrible
names that two of them were actually abashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and got out of the first boat to give their places to
two women.</p>

<p>To make the scene more dismal it had begun to
rain, such a cold, penetrating rain! Poor little
Winnie clung to me and I could hear her praying:
"Please God, save Mamma, and Papa, and
me, and Miss Pore, and her papa, too, and the
giant." She always called George the giant.
"Don't let us get drownded dead!"</p>

<p>We got off at last! Winnie and her mother
and father were in the boat with us. That was
something George Massie managed. He saw
that the father, Mr. Trask, was a good, reliable
man and could help with the boat, and he also felt
that Mrs. Trask and Winnie would need me,
which they did. There were five other men in
the boat with us and one other woman: a nice old
Irish chambermaid, who never stopped praying
a single moment until we were safe on the high
seas in our tiny boat with the waves dashing all
around us and the rain pouring on us.</p>

<p>I felt much safer on the steamer, although
when we left her she had listed until her decks
were at an angle of forty-five degrees. Of course
the wireless had been busy sending appeals for
help but we were three hours getting any. Mrs.
Trask was very ill and had to lie in the bottom of
the boat, where her husband and Father made
her as comfortable as possible. Winnie sat in
my lap and I wrapped her in a great rug that
George had thrown around me. We kept each
other warm under the rug and gave each other
courage, too.</p>

<p>The vessel that picked us up was not very gracious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
about it. They had picked up so many
shipwrecked persons since the war began that it
was an old story to them and not at all interesting.
It was a fishing smack and smelled worse
than anything I have ever imagined in the way
of odors. Poor Mrs. Trask actually fainted
again from the stench of fish offal.</p>

<p>True to the captain's promise, we did land
sometime during the night, but we were not safely
in bed as he had hoped, but propped up in the
foul little cabin of the fishing smack trying to
choke down some vile black coffee that one of the
men, not so hardened to shipwrecks as the rest,
had humanely concocted for us.</p>

<p>This is about all, dear Page! We got to bed
when we reached Liverpool and stayed there for
twenty-four hours. I kept Winnie with me,
thereby saving the poor little thing the agony of
seeing her mother die. Poor Mrs. Trask passed
away the day after we landed. She was not
strong enough to stand the shock and exposure.
Mr. Trask is an Englishman and was going home
to enlist and leave his wife and child with his own
people. His wife thought it right but was evidently
in the deepest misery over his decision.
Maybe she was not sorry to die. I am so sorry
for him and for the dear little girl. She is to
come to Grantley Grange to visit me soon.</p>

<p>I can never tell you how splendid George Massie
was. He was so brave and so determined. I
did not dream he could command men as he did.
He says it is football training that made him
know what to do and how to do it. He is going
to France next week to join the Red Cross as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
stretcher bearer, I think. I shall miss him ever
so much but know it is right for him to help if he
can. Service is in the air here in England.
There is no more talk of who you are or what you
own or what your ancestors have done. It is:
<i>What can you do? Then do it!</i></p>

<p>It is a tremendous experience to be in the midst
of this war. No one talks anything but war.
There are no entertainments of any sort except
the theatres. I believe they keep them open to
cheer up the people. The fields are full of
women; the factories are kept up by them; the
trams and busses are run by them,&mdash;in fact they
do anything and everything that men did before
the war.</p>

<p>You remember, do you not, how I was so
afraid my clothes would look poor and mean and
out of style? Well, on the contrary, for once in
my life, I am better dressed than the persons with
whom I come in contact. I am really ashamed
to be so much better dressed than the other girls.
It seems so frivolous of me. I know you can't
help smiling to think of what the others' clothes
must be.</p>

<p>I am writing to my dear Tuckers, too, and if
you read their letter and they read yours you can
piece together what my life here is. Please send
them on to Mary Flannagan when you have finished
reading them. I have not time to write
another long letter just now.</p>

<p>Besides singing to the soldiers, I am to teach
music to the children in Father's school. You
can readily see how busy I am to be.</p>

<p>I shall never cease to miss my dear friends in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Virginia. Some day I hope to come back to
America, but in the meantime I am going to do
my bit here in England. Please write to me!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LETTER FROM GEORGE MASSIE TO PAGE ALLISON</div>


<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;"><i>Paris, France.</i></span><br />
<i>Poste Restante.</i><br />
</div>

<span class="smcap">My dear Page:</span>

<p>I left England last week after having
stopped with the Pores at Grantley Grange for
ten days or so. Say, Page, the old one ain't half
bad! If you could have heard him swear when
the beasts crowded in the life-boats ahead of the
women, you would have forgot the grouch we
had on about the way he has always done Annie.
Say, that man can swear! I wonder where he
has kept it all these years.</p>

<p>Of course, if a fellow ever is going to swear, it
will be at a time like that, and if he doesn't swear
some, it is because he is dumb. It is the kind of
time when some women pray and some weep and
most men swear. They don't mean anything,
but it is just a kind of safety valve. Annie says
I swore like a trooper, but I wasn't conscious of
it at all. It just popped out of me. You see I
had to intimidate the men who were behaving like
cads, and the only way I knew how to do it was to
swear, unless it was to biff them one with the
oars, and I did not want to do that except as a
last resort. The swearing worked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very terrible experience and one I
hope never to have to undergo again. It was not
only terrible to think that all of those people
might be at the bottom of the ocean in a short
while, but it was almost worse to see the way
people can be so scared that they think only of
themselves. I reckon a fellow ought not to
blame them. It seemed just blind animal instinct
for self-preservation. My Annie was a
trump. She was as calm and quiet as though
shipwrecks had been an every-day experience
with her. She looked out for a little child and
its sick mother and helped people and quieted
women and men, and after we had been afloat in
our life-boat for hours and it was cold and rainy
and the poor sick woman and an old Irish chambermaid
began to despair and the kid began to
cry, what should my Annie do but begin to sing
"Abide With Me." I have never heard her sing
better than she did out in the middle of that dirty
sea. It did all of us good, and before you knew
it, a little fishing smack almost ran us down in
the darkness and then had the decency to stop
and haul us aboard.</p>

<p>I reckon you think I'm pretty gaully to be saying
"my Annie" so glibly. She's not really my
Annie but she is going to be if I can make good.
Of course I know she is too young to make her
give an answer to me yet, but this war is going to
age all of us, and when it is over I'll be a steady
old man with white whiskers, and if Annie likes
'em, I'm going to get her answer then. I don't
want to tie her up but leave her free. She might
see a handsome Johnny that will put crimps in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
my plans and I want her to take him if she likes
him, but I tell you, Page, I'm going to pray
every day and all day from now until the war is
over that she will like me best. The old man
likes me. It seems I earned his undying gratitude
by waiting on him when he was seasick and
the doctor on board had made light of his ailment.
I made out he was sick unto death and
worked my fool fat self to a shadow fetching and
carrying for him. Then when the explosion
came and I did my best to keep order, he kind of
cottoned to me more. I believe when I come
back from the wars and beg an answer from
Annie that His Nibs will be willing.</p>

<p>He is much more attractive in his English setting.
He really isn't half bad. His sisters are
making a lot over Annie and now he is kind of
getting stuck on her himself. 'Tain't so bad to
be a woman in England now. Folks are thinking
a good deal of women, and I tell you they
should do so. Annie says he has always been
sore that she was not a boy. Looks as though he
had a hunch that he might inherit the title some
day. I call him the old man right to his face, as
somehow I can't school myself to say Sir Arthur.
It is too story booky for me.</p>

<p>I am here in France waiting to be sent out with
the Red Cross. I may drive an ambulance and
I may just be a stretcher bearer. I will do whatever
they see fit to put me to doing. There is
plenty to do, they tell me, and they welcome
every American who comes over with joy and
gratitude. I wish we were in it as a nation. I
believe we will end there, and if we do, I tell you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
someone else can drive the ambulance, as I mean
to get in the game without a red cross on my
sleeve.</p>

<p>You don't know what I feel towards all of you
girls, all of Annie's friends. I have lived to
bless the day that I met you, although on that
day I did anything but bless it. You remember
how you bundled me up in the soiled clothes
ready to send me to the laundry? I'll never forget
it! Also, I'll never forget that you and the
Tucker twins never told the rest of the fellows
about it. That was sure white of you! Please
put in a good word for me when you write to
Annie, my Annie.</p>

<span style="margin-right: 3em;"><i>Bracken, Va.</i></span><br />

</div>

<span class="smcap">My dearest Tweedles:</span>

<p>I am sending you letters from Annie
and from Sleepy. I am awfully excited about
Sleepy. He seems to be wide awake. Father
says he will come through the war and be a distinguished
person of some sort, he believes. I
think Annie's letter is awfully interesting. Isn't
it fun for old Sir Arthur Ponsonby Pore to have
won the love of the Lady Annie by swearing? I
know your father will die laughing over it.</p>

<p>I am up to my neck with Miss Pinkie Davis in
the house, getting some sewing done so I won't
have to be worried with shirt-waists and things
when we get to New York. Mammy Susan is
still miffed with me for going, and I feel awfully
bad about it. Isn't it great that Mary can go,
too? Do you reckon we'll see Jessie Wilcox in
New York? Not if she sees us first, I fancy!
Four girls in a flat and that flat not so very swell
wouldn't appeal to Miss Wilcox, I think.</p>

<p>Father is giving iron tonics right and left, and
has made up a gallon of pump water with a beautiful
pink vegetable dye in it for Sally Winn so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
she won't have to die before he gets back. Poor
Joe Winn is very sad that I did not let him know
you were here on the last trip. I really forgot
to do it. We were having such a wildly exciting
time making our plans for New York that poor
Joe never came into my head.</p>

<p>It is so splendid that Father is going, too. If
these people will only stay well until he can get
started, then they can be sick all they want and
have a doctor over from the crossing. There is a
perfectly good doctor there, that is, a perfectly
good doctor if one is prepared for death!</p>

<p>Good-by! I must stop and help Miss Pinkie.
How I do hate to sew! To think in a few days
almost I'll be <span class="smcap">In New York With the Tucker
Twins</span>.</p>

<p>Would you like to admit to your circle
of friends the most charming of college
girls? Then seek an introduction
to Molly Brown. You will find the baggagemaster,
the cook, the Professor of
English Literature and the College President
in the same company.</p>


<div class='unindent'><b><i><span class='big'>Molly Brown's Sophomore Days</span></i></b></div>

<p>What is more delightful than a reunion
of college girls after the summer
vacation? Certainly nothing that precedes
it in their experience&mdash;at least, if all class-mates are as
happy together as the Wellington girls of this story. Among
Molly's interesting friends of the second year is a young
Japanese girl, who ingratiates her "humbly" self into everybody's
affections.</p>


<div class='unindent'><b><i><span class='big'>Molly Brown's Junior Days</span></i></b></div>

<p>Financial stumbling blocks are not the only thing that hinder
the ease and increase the strength of college girls. Their
troubles and their triumphs are their own, often peculiar to their
environment. How Wellington students meet the experiences
outside the class-rooms is worth the doing, the telling and the
reading.</p>


<div class='unindent'><b><i><span class='big'>Molly Brown's Senior Days</span></i></b></div>

<p>This book tells of another year of glad college life, bringing the
girls to the days of diplomas and farewells, and introducing
new friends to complicate old friendships.</p>


<div class='unindent'><b><i><span class='big'>Molly Brown's Post Graduate Days</span></i></b></div>

<p>"Book I" of this volume is devoted to incidents that happen
in Molly's Kentucky home, and "Book II" is filled with the
interests pertaining to Wellington College and the reunions of a
post graduate year.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Molly's romance culminates in Paris&mdash;the Paris of art, of
music, of light-hearted gaiety&mdash;after a glad, sad, mad year for
Molly and her friends.</p>

<p>If you do not know Molly Brown of Kentucky, you are missing
an opportunity to become acquainted with the most enchanting
girl in college fiction.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
